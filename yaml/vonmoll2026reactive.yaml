  Dynamic Maneuvering Cue
abstractNote: Recent approaches for navigating among dynamic threat regions (i.e.,
  weapon engagement zones) have focused on planning entire trajectories. Moreover,
  the allowance for penetration into these threat regions was based on heuristic measurements
  of risk    This paper offers an approach for a more reactive (i.e., feedback-based)
  guidance that is based on closed-form analytical expressions and thereby suitable
  for onboard, real-time execution. In addition, a risk measurement is formulated
  based upon the concept of Dynamic Maneuvering Cue (DMC) which measures the amount
  of turn a vehicle would need to take in its current state in order to put itself
  outside the threat region. This approach is then extended to handle multiple threat
  regions simultaneously (with minimal additional computational complexity). Finally,
  the DMC constraint is applied to a simple feedback controller as well as a model
  predictive controller (MPC). The MPC shows better performance but at the cost of
  having to solve an optimization problem online versus the meager computational burden
  associated with the simple controller. This approach, which is based on assuming
  the threats are adversarial, may be used as a conservative method for collision
  avoidance and deconfliction.
