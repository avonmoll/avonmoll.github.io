  a Team Seeking
abstractNote: This paper explores a multi-agent containment problem, where a fast
  evader, modeled having constant speed and using constant heading, attempts to escape
  a circular containment region that is orbited by a slower team of pursuers with
  a nonzero capture radius. Two distinct multi-agent dynamic models cases are explored,
  the first uses a unicycle dynamics model with strict constraints, while the second
  uses a double integrator model with looser constraints and consensus laws implemented
  with a communication network. This paper considers the scenario wherein some of
  the pursuers get compromised and turn into malicious agents that suffer a delay
  in initiating the capture pursuit. A boost countermeasure is proposed and its effectiveness
  is investigated. This work provides a foundation for a consensus case that incorporates
  more restrictions in motion and extensions to larger teams of pursuers, as well
  as a more dynamic evader model.
