  within the Turret Defense Differential
abstractNote: We extend the Turret Defense Differential Game by considering the possibility
  for the mobile Attacker to retreat to a particular region of the state space in
  lieu of engaging the Turret. In this case, the Turret cooperates with the Attacker
  by escorting the Attacker to the retreat surface, thereby minimizing its cost. Along
  the retreat trajectory, the cost associated with the Value of the Game of Engagement
  must be greater than the cost associated with retreating. We refer to this scenario
  as Optimal Constrained Retreat, wherein the aforementioned requirement is imposed
  as a path constraint. The optimality conditions are developed herein. We specify
  a boundary value problem with fixed initial state and compute the optimal trajectory
  numerically via backwards shooting. The corresponding trajectory contains a constrained
  arc wherein the path constraint associated with the Game of Engagement becomes active.
