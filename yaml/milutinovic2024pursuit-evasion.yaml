  and When it Can
abstractNote: In classical works on a planar differential pursuit-evasion game with
  a faster pursuer, the intercept point resulting from the equilibrium strategies
  lies on the Apollonius circle. This property was exploited for the construction
  of the equilibrium strategies for two faster pursuers against one evader. Extensions
  for planar multiple-pursuer single-evader scenarios have been considered. We study
  a pursuit-evasion game on a sphere and the relation of the equilibrium intercept
  point to the Apollonius domain on the sphere. The domain is a generalization of
  the planar Apollonius circle set. We find a condition resulting in the intercept
  point belonging to the Apollonius domain, which is the characteristic of the planar
  game solution. Finally, we use this characteristic to discuss pursuit and evasion
  strategies in the context of two pursuers and a single slower evader on the sphere
  and illustrate it using numerical simulations.
