  of Multiple Engagement Zones
abstractNote: This work formulates the feedback control strategies for vehicles to
  reach a goal point amongst a field of dynamic risk regions. Whereas previous work
  has considered deterministic versions of this problem, we consider the scenario
  in the context of uncertainty. This uncertainty could be due to unknown wind or
  other external disturbances. The risk regions’ dynamics are tightly coupled to the
  state of the vehicle and as a result the task of navigating through a field dynamically
  changes as the vehicle traverses through it. Rather than using a nonlinear program
  solver, the approach taken here is one of formulating the problem as a stochastic
  optimal control problem wherein a feedback control law is derived. This feedback
  control law allows a single or multiple vehicles to reach the desired goal location
  efficiently and with minimal risk incursion. When inside a risk region, there is
  a probability rate of the vehicle being neutralized. The stochastic dynamical system
  is modeled as a hybrid system, i.e., regime switching diffusion. The hybrid system
  is comprised of continuous spatial dynamics and discrete operational states corresponding
  to “normal” and “neutralized”. The optimal control problem is discretized into a
  field of vehicle states and control. Using Value Iteration, the control signal at
  each discrete location is optimized, providing a feedback control strategy over
  the field. Following a discussion of the methods and approaches, this problem is
  formulated, simulations are performed, and conclusions and remarks are made.
