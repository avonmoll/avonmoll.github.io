  Non-Maneuvering Target by
abstractNote: This paper considers a two agent scenario containing an observer and
  a non-maneuvering target. The observer is maneuverable but is slower than the course-holding
  target. In this scenario, the observer is endowed with a nonzero radius of observation
  within which he strives at keeping the target for as long as possible. Using the
  calculus of variations we pose and solve the optimal control problem, solving for
  the heading of the observer which maximizes the amount of time the target remains
  inside the radius of observation. Utilizing the optimal observer heading we compute
  the exposure time based upon the angle by which the target is initially captured.
  Presented, along with an example, are the zero-time of exposure heading, maximum
  time of observation heading, and proof that observation is persistent under optimal
  control.
