  Intercept a Target Moving
abstractNote: We present a path planning problem for a pursuing agent to intercept
  a target traveling on a circle. The target is cooperative, and its position, heading
  and speed are precisely known by the pursuing agent. The pursuing agent has nonholonomic
  motion constraints, and therefore the path traveled by the pursuing agent must satisfy
  the minimum turn radius constraints. We consider the class of Dubins paths as candidate
  solutions, and analyze the characteristics of the six modes of Dubins paths where
  the final position is restricted to lie on the target circle with heading in the
  tangential direction of the circle. For each Dubins mode, we derive the feasibility
  limits, discontinuities and local extrema. Using this analysis the intercepting
  paths are found by a systematic bisection search in the feasible regions of each
  of the Dubins modes. We prove that the algorithm outputs the optimal solution, if
  the optimal intercepting path is a Dubins path; otherwise, it outputs the best found
  intercepting path and a tight lower bound to the optimal solution.
