  with Finite Range
abstractNote: We consider a perimeter defense problem in a planar conical environment
  comprising a single turret that has a finite range and non-zero service time. The
  turret seeks to defend a concentric perimeter against N ≥ 2 intruders. Upon release,
  each intruders move radially towards the perimeter with a fixed speed. To capture
  an intruder, the turret’s angle must be aligned with that of the intruder’s angle
  and must spend a specified capture time at that orientation. We present an online
  and an offline approach to this optimal problem. Specifically, for the offline approach,
  we establish that for general parameter regimes, this problem is equivalent to solving
  a Travelling Repairperson Problem with Time Windows (TRP- TW). We then identify
  specific parameter regimes in which there is a polynomial time algorithm that maximizes
  the number of intruders captured. For the online approach we present a competitive
  analysis technique in which we establish a fundamental guarantee on the existence
  of at best (N − 1)- competitive algorithms and design two online algorithms that
  are provably 1 and 2-competitive in specific parameter regimes.
