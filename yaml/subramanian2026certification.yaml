  Systems using End-to-End Distributionally-Robust Uncertainty
abstractNote: 'We present OptimalUncertaintyQuantification.jl: A Julia tool for end-to-end
  distributionally robust uncertainty quantification of static and dynamical systems
  models. It provides an ergonomic symbolic interface for modeling the system as well
  as principled inclusion of data and knowledge about uncertainities. Furthermore,
  it automatically transforms the certification problem into a computationally tractable
  optimization problem solvable by integrated solvers. We demonstrate this tool on
  the benchmark Moore-Greitzer Ordinary Differential Equation model and provide an
  iterative workflow for model-based systems designers to meet safety certification
  targets.'
