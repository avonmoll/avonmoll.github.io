  Pure Pursuit
abstractNote: The Pure Pursuit strategy is ubiquitous both in the control literature
  but also in real-world implementation. In this paper, we pose and solve a variant
  of Isaacs' Two Cutters and Fugitive Ship problem wherein the Pursuers' strategy
  is fixed to Pure Pursuit, thus making it an optimal control problem. The Pursuers
  are faster than the Evader and are endowed with a finite capture radius. All agents
  move with constant velocity and can change heading instantaneously. Although capture
  is inevitable, the Evader wishes to delay capture as long as possible. The optimal
  trajectories cover the entire state space. Regions corresponding to either solo
  capture or isochronous (dual) capture are computed and both types of maximal time-to-capture
  optimal trajectories are characterized.
