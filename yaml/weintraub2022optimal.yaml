  Avoidance Scenario in 2-D
abstractNote: In this paper, an optimal control problem is considered where a target
  vehicle aims to reach a desired location in minimum time while avoiding a dynamic
  engagement zone. Using simple motion, four potential approaches are considered.
  First, the min-time strategy which ignores the engagement zone is posed and solved.
  Second, the min-time strategy which avoids the engagement zone entirely is considered.
  Third, the min-time strategy which allows for some time in the engagement zone;
  but, still strives to stay away from the center of the engagement zone is posed.
  Lastly, a fixed final-time strategy is considered, wherein the target tries to avoid
  the engagement zone; but, is required to arrive at the desired location at a specific
  time. Using a nonlinear program solver, the optimal strategies are numerically solved.
  From the results of the numeric solutions, the optimal strategies are discussed
  and comparisons are drawn.
