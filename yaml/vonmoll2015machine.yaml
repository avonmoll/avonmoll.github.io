  in Complex Control Systems
abstractNote: 'The intersection between machine learning and control theory is emerging
  rapidly; many rich applications are currently being developed. This report explores
  one particular area of interest: trajectory optimization. The Linear Quadratic Regulator
  and Linear Quadratic Gaussian algorithms are introduced as predecessors to the Iterative
  Linear Quadratic Gaussian (iLQG) algorithm, which is re-derived in this report and
  demonstrated on 3 systems of interest: cartpole, double cartpole, and quadrotor.
  iLQG is robust and widely applicable to a vast number of different systems. Probabilistic
  Differential Dynamic Programming (PDDP) is introduced as an important extension
  to iLQG which incorporates uncertainty into the trajectory optimization process.
  The conceptual advances presented in this report were centered around the use of
  a Gaussian Process Regression Network (GPRN) to represent the unknown system dynamics
  in lieu of the standard Gaussian Process representation employed by PDDP. GPRNs
  offer a more sophisticated noise model and a more adaptive regression framework.
  More speciffcally, they incorporate input-dependent noise and signal correlation
  between multiple outputs. This should enhance the predictive capability of the algorithm
  to represent the unknown system dynamics. Work remains on fully incorporating GPRN
  into a PDDP-like algorithm: effort continues in the areas of understanding variational
  Bayes and variational message passing for learning GPRN hyperparameters, and in
  creating a MATLAB implementation.'
