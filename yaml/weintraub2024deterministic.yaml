  Planning Around Multiple Threats
abstractNote: Previous methods for avoiding dynamic engagement zones leverage the
  calculus of variations to obtain optimal path plans for avoiding risk and reaching
  a desired target location [1,2]. While this method is deterministic; it scales poorly
  as the number of engagement zones increases. Furthermore, it is inherently sensitive
  to initial guesses and finding local minimums can be problematic. This talk presents
  a novel approach that uses deterministic approaches to obtain a set of feasible
  flight plans for reaching the desired destination and reports when no such plan
  exists. Furthermore, it uses an efficient scheme for feeding initial guesses to
  a nonlinear program solver that provides flyable path plans that mitigate risk.
  Lastly, a tool is developed that measures the risk of the flight path for avoiding
  a large field of engagement zones, providing useful information to improve battle
  management. The solution process begins with using the location of each weapon engagement
  zone and associated model to obtain a Voronoi partition of the environment. This
  partitioning is used to construct a feasibility graph signifying navigation through
  each pair of weapon engagement zones. Once constructed each edge of the graph borders
  two opposing weapon engagement zones for which the target vehicle aims to navigate
  between. If the pair of engagement zones can not be penetrated due to the distance
  and size of those zones; then the associated edge of the graph is deleted. This
  process is iteratively performed until each edge has been evaluated. Upon completion
  of the feasibility graph, path plans are attained using graph-based search to minimize
  the time of arrival. Next, the provided solution is fed to a nonlinear program solver
  that smooths the solution or solutions from the feasibility path according to the
  vehicle dynamics. The resulting solutions are analyzed through a simplified simulation
  to assess risk and time of arrival.  Presented are the methods used to solve this
  navigational problem, results of the simulated trajectories, and future research
  directions. [1] Isaac E. Weintraub, Alexander Von Moll, Christian A. Carrizales,
