  in the Lake
abstractNote: In the Lady in the Lake scenario, a mobile agent, 𝐿, is pitted against
  an agent, 𝑀, who is constrained to move along the perimeter of a circle. 𝐿 is assumed
  to begin inside the circle and wishes to escape to the perimeter with some finite
  angular separation from 𝑀 at the perimeter. This scenario has, in the past, been
  formulated as a zerosum differential game wherein 𝐿 seeks to maximize terminal separation
  and 𝑀 seeks to minimize it. Its solution is well-known. However, there is a large
  portion of the state space for which the canonical solution does not yield a unique
  equilibrium strategy. This paper provides such a unique strategy by solving an auxiliary
  zero-sum differential game. In the auxiliary differential game, 𝐿 seeks to reach
  a point opposite of 𝑀 at a radius for which their maximum angular speeds are equal
  (i.e., the antipodal point). 𝐿 wishes to minimize the time to reach this point while
  𝑀 wishes to maximize it. The solution of the auxiliary differential game is comprised
  of a Focal Line, a Universal Line, and their tributaries. The Focal Line tributaries’
  equilibrium strategy for 𝐿 is semi-analytic, while the Universal Line tributaries’
  equilibrium strategy is obtained in closed form.
