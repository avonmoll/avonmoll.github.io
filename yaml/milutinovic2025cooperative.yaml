  Games with a Flat Sphere Condition
abstractNote: In planar pursuit-evasion differential games considering a faster pursuer
  and a slower evader, the interception points resulting from equilibrium strategies
  lie on the Apollonius circle. This property is instrumental for leveraging geometric
  approaches for solving multiple pursuit-evasion scenarios in the plane. Here, we
  study a pursuit-evasion differential game on a sphere and generalize the planar
  Apollonius circle to the spherical domain. For the differential game, we provide
  equilibrium strategies for all initial conditions, including a special case when
  the pursuer and evader are on opposite sides of the sphere where a dilemma occurs.
  In contrast to planar scenarios, on the sphere we find that the interception point
  from the equilibrium strategies can leave the Apollonius domain boundary. We present
  a condition to ensure the intercept point remains on the boundary of the Apollonius
  domain. This condition allows for generalizing planar pursuit-evasion strategies
  to the sphere, and we show how these results are applied by analyzing the scenarios
  of target guarding and two-pursuer, single evader differential games on the sphere.
