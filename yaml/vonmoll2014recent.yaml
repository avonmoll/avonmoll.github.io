abstractNote: 'Thermal management has emerged as one of the primary challenges for
  modern military gas turbine engines. Fuel actuator pumping systems contribute to
  the challenge by constantly injecting waste heat into the fuel system. This is due
  to a fundamental mismatching between an actuation system with a low duty cycle and
  a pump which is always running. Since the pump is directly coupled to the gearbox,
  the detriment is twofold: horsepower is always being drawn to drive the pump, and
  heat is generated. Furthermore, the emergence of variable cycle engines pushes the
  actuation system in the direction of more effectors and more loads, which drives
  requirements for high pressure and high flows from the pumping system. Piston pumps
  have been seen as favorable for the actuation pump application due to their high
  single stage pressure rise capability. However reducing the number of pumping components
  alone has not solved the thermal management issue. Variable displacement pumps have
  been designed to operate over a range of conditions in order to deliver flow more
  appropriately as demanded by the control system. These pumps allow pressure and
  flow to be modulated independent of one another and of the pumpâ€™s rotational speed.
  Variable displacement pumps may be considered as a component of a partial-demand
  actuation pumping system. Even in a partial-demand actuation pumping system, a variable
  displacement pump will still be coupled to the gearbox and require some minimum
  flow for lubrication and cooling. On-demand actuation fuel systems deliver only
  the amount of flow that is being demanded at a given time so that waste heat is
  minimized. In other words, the duty cycle of the pumping system matches that of
  the actuation system. The development of an on-demand actuation fuel system will
  require a new architecture and new components.'
