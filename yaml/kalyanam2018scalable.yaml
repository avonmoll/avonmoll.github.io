  for UAV Persistent
abstractNote: We are interested in the persistent surveillance of an area of interest
  comprised of stations/ data nodes. The data collection task is undertaken by a UAV
  which autonomously executes the mission. Each node has a priority/ weight associated
  with it that characterizes the relative importance between timely collection of
  data from the nodes. In this context, a prudent performance metric is the maximal
  weighted time between consecutive visits to each node. We wish to minimize the maximum
  of this metric among all nodes for a given cycle length. Here, the cycle length
  refers to the total number of nodes (including repeats) visited per cycle. When
  the cycle length is greater than the number of nodes, some nodes, arguably ones
  with a higher priority, will be visited more often. We pose the problem as a Mixed
  Integer Linear Program (MILP), that computes the optimal visit sequence and number
  of visits to each node for a given cycle length. Not surprisingly, the exact method
  is not scalable with the number of nodes and the cycle length. We therefore present
  sub-optimal methods  by directly enforcing a pre-specified number of visits to each
  node. We present an iterative scheme that computes solutions for increasing cycle
  length with a recipe for updating the number of visits based on the solution from
  the previous iteration. We compare the optimal and sub-optimal iterative schemes
  and show that the sub-optimal scheme is an order of magnitude faster than the optimal
  scheme with minimal loss in performance.
