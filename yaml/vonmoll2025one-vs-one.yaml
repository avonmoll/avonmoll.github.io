  with Basic Engagement Zones
abstractNote: 'In this paper we address the problem of ''weaponeering'', i.e., placing
  the weapon engagement zone (WEZ) of a vehicle on a moving target, while simultaneously
  avoiding the target''s WEZ. A WEZ describes the lethality region of a range-limited
  weapon considering both the range of the weapon along with the state of the target.
  The weapons are assumed to have simple motion, while the vehicles carrying the weapons
  are modeled with Dubins dynamics. Three scenarios are investigated and are differentiated
  in the assumptions that can be made about the target in the process of the vehicle
  control design: 1) no knowledge of target control, 2) avoid unsafe positions assuming
  the target''s optimal control, 3) full knowledge of target''s optimal control. The
  engagement is formulated as a stochastic optimal control problem with uncertainty
  in the target''s control modeled using a noise parameter applied to the target''s
  control input. After discretizing the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, Value iteration
  is then used to obtain an approximate solution for the optimal vehicle control and
  time-to-go. Simulation results support usage of the first paradigm: assume no knowledge
  of the target''s control.'
