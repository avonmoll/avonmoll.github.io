abstractNote: In pursuit-evasion the objective of the pursuer is to capture the evader.
  In this work, the faster pursuer is modeled to have limited range and therefore
  optimal strategies for the pursuer and evader change. This paper describes the optimal
  strategies and nuances that appear for point-capture or when the pursuer is endowed
  with a non-zero capture radius.
