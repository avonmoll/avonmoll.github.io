  in Conical Environments
abstractNote: We consider a perimeter defense problem in a planar conical environment
  in which M identical vehicles, each having a finite capture radius, seek to defend
  a concentric perimeter from mobile intruders. The intruders are released at the
  circumference of the environment at arbitrary times and in any number. Upon release,
  each intruder moves radially toward the perimeter with fixed speed. We provide a
  worst-case analysis of this problem. Specifically, we present a competitive analysis
  approach to this problem by measuring the performance of decentralized and cooperative
  online algorithms for the vehicles against arbitrary inputs, relative to an optimal
  offline algorithm that has information about entire intruder release sequence in
  advance. In particular, apart from the minimum number of vehicles required to capture
  all intruders, we establish a necessary condition on the parameter space to guarantee
  finite competitive- ness of any algorithm. We then design and analyze three decen-
  tralized and two cooperative online algorithms and characterize parameter regimes
  in which they have finite competitive ratios. Specifically, our first two decentralized
  algorithms are provably 1, and 2-competitive, respectively, whereas our third decentralized
  algorithm exhibit different competitive ratios in different regimes of problem parameters.
  Similarly, our first cooperative algorithm is 1.5-competitive and our second cooperative
  algorithm exhibits different competitive ratios in different regimes of problem
  parameters. We then provide multiple numerical plots in the parameter space to reveal
  additional insights into the relative performance of our algorithms and discuss
  an extension to the case of heterogeneous vehicles.
