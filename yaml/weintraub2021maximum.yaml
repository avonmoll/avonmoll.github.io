  by a Slower
abstractNote: In this work, we consider a two-agent scenario consisting of an observer
  and non-maneuvering target. In the scenario, the observer is considered to be maneuverable
  and slower than the target. The observer is endowed with a nonzero radius of observation
  within which he strives at keeping the target for as long as possible. Using the
  calculus of variations, we pose and solve the optimal control problem, solving for
  the heading and flight path angle of the observer to maximize the amount of time
  the target vehicle is contained within his observation radius. Using the optimal
  observer heading and flight path angle, the exposure time is computed, based upon
  the initial azimuth and elevation by which the target is captured by the observer.
  The special cases, where the engagement may be represented in a plane, rather than
  3-D, are also provided. Presented, along with examples, are the zero-time of exposure
  conditions, maximum exposure time conditions, and a proof that observation is persistent
  under the optimal observer strategy.
