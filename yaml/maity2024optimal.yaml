  Limited Pursuer
abstractNote: This paper investigates a partial-information pur- suit evasion game
  in which the Pursuer has a limited-range sensor to detect the Evader. Given a fixed
  final time, we derive the optimal evasion strategy for the Evader to maximize its
  distance from the pursuer at the end. Our analysis reveals that in certain parametric
  regimes, the optimal Evasion strategy involves a ‘risky’ maneuver, where the Evader’s
  trajectory comes extremely close to the pursuer’s sensing boundary before moving
  behind the Pursuer. Additionally, we explore a special case in which the Pursuer
  can choose the final time. In this scenario, we determine a (Nash) equilibrium pair
  for both the final time and the evasion strategy.
