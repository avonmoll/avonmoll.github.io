  for Optimal Target-Attacker-Defender Game
abstractNote: We present a two vehicle, cooperating path planning problem in adversarial
  environments. The first vehicle is the lead vehicle and its path is prescribed to
  accomplish a certain mission,and there exists multiple attackers along this path.
  The second vehicle is a defender that travelsalong the lead vehicle, and it is responsible
  to protect the lead vehicle from the attackers. The defender launches defender missile
  to intercept the attackers before it reaches the lead vehicle. The defender and
  lead vehicle cooperate to maximize the distance between the lead vehicle and the
  point of interception, while the attacker tries to minimize this distance. This
  sub problem is modeled as Target-Attacker-Defender (TAD) game with an objective
  to maximize the terminal separation distance between lead vehicle and attacker.
  We aim to generate an optimal pathfor the defender, such that if the TAD game is
  played at any point along the path, the defender should be optimally positioned
  that maximizes the terminal separation distance. We reduce this problem to a discrete
  space, and methodically pose it as a shortest path problem on a graph, the solution
  of which gives the discrete optimal path for the defender.
