abstractNote: The Dubins path problem had enormous applications in path planning for
  autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we consider a generalization of the Dubins path
  planning problem, which is to find a shortest Dubins path that starts from a given
  initial position and heading, and ends on a given target circle with the heading
  in the tangential direction. This problem has direct applications in Dubins neighborhood
  traveling salesman problem, obstacle avoidance Dubins path planning problem etc.
  We characterize the length of the four CSC paths as a function of angular position
  on the target circle, and derive the conditions which to find the shortest Dubins
  path to the target circle.
