  Architectures and Network Topologies for
abstractNote: A distributed engine control system (DECS) offering flexibility and
  scalability is envisioned for the next generation of propulsion controls. Perhaps
  the most touted benefit of a DECS is the potential to reduce the amount of harnessing
  which connects throughout the engine. Such a system is comprised of several network
  sections incorporating control nodes or data concentrators (DCs). These DCs contain
  control logic to perform control function computations and are connected to the
  full authority digital engine control (FADEC) via a high-speed data communication
  bus. A novel approach for analyzing and evaluating three topologies–ring, star,
  and bus–in the context of a relevant military engine was described. In this study,
  the algorithm uses a particle swarm optimization process to evolve solutions to
  a multi-objective optimization problem. The results of this study indicate there
  is potential for large wire length savings in a distributed control architecture.
