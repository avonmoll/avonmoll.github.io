  Proximal Sensing of
abstractNote: The time-optimal strategy for a pursuer, endowed with a guided off-board
  sensor, is found to place the range-limited sensor platform onto a non-maneuvering
  target. Leveraging optimal control theory, a feedback control strategy is obtained
  for the pursuer using the indirect optimal control method. The target is assumed
  to have constant speed and move slower than the off-board sensor and the pursuer.
  The limited-range off-board sensor is assumed to be faster than the pursuer and
  the target. The pursuer is assumed to have unlimited range and is faster than the
  target but slower than the off-board sensor platform. All agents' communication,
  location, and heading are assumed known by all; the scenario assumes communication
  between the pursuer and off-board sensor is ideal. This work presents how the optimal
  control approach can be leveraged as well as highlighted in example simulations
  and an accompanying discussion of those results.
