  Two Pursuer One Evader
abstractNote: The Two Cutters and Fugitive Ship game posed by Isaacs is revisited
  again. We discuss and analyze the singular configuration of this two-pursuer one-evader
  differential game. This paper addresses the question of whether or not either player
  has the ability to exploit the dispersal surface. Specifically, we in- vestigate
  the case where the Evader effectively stands still (e.g., by dithering in a small
  neighborhood). We show that the canonical optimal pursuit policy yields chattering
  in the discrete-time version of the game. As the timestep approaches zero, the capture
  time approaches the Value of the game, and thus the Evader is not penalized for
  standing still. Implications on related scenarios are discussed.
