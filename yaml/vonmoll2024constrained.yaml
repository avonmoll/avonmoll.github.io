  with Fixed Final Time
abstractNote: 'In this paper, we extend existing turret defense differential game
  formulations involving a turn-constrained turret and mobile agent to include specified
  final time and a constraint. For the purposes of this analysis, the specified final
  time may represent some exogenous input, perhaps representing the time at which
  some other event will take place. As for the constraint, it represents a keep-out
  zone for the mobile agent. The scenario is formulated as a two-player, zero-sum
  differential game and solved via the method of characteristics (i.e., back-propagation
  of equilibrium trajectories). Three different trajectory types make up the solution:
  trajectories that end with the turret aligned with the mobile agent, trajectories
  that end with the mobile agent on the constraint boundary, and regular trajectories.'
