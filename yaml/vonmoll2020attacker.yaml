  in the Turret Defense Differential
abstractNote: 'The characteristics for the solution to the Turret Defense Differential
  Game are explored over the parameter space. We collapse the five natural parameters
  of capture radius, attacker speed, turret turn rate, time penalty constant, and
  look-angle penalty constant into two composite parameters in order to facilitate
  the analysis. There exist three singular surfaces in the game, two of which have
  an analytic form, and one which can only be obtained numerically. We focus on the
  latter: the Attacker Dispersal Surface, wherein the attacker can choose between
  an indirect or direct route to capture. For certain parameter settings, the Attacker
  Dispersal Surface is present, while for others, the surface is absent. These regions
  in the parameter space are identified, and the numerical procedures to do so are
  detailed. Backwards shooting of the optimal state and adjoint dynamics features
  prominently in the procedures. Two pieces of numerical evidence are utilized to
  indicate the presence or absence of the Attacker Dispersal Surface.'
