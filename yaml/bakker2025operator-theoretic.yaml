  Differential Games
abstractNote: Differential game theory offers an approach for modeling interactions
  between two or more agents that occur in continuous time. The goal of each agent
  is to optimize its objective cost functional. In this paper, we present two different
  methods, based on the Koopman Operator (KO), to solve a zero-sum differential game.
  The first approach uses the resolvent of the KO to calculate a continuous-time global
  feedback solution over the entire domain. The second approach uses a discrete-time,
  data-driven KO representation with control to calculate open- loop control policies
  one trajectory at a time. We demonstrate these methods on a turret defense game
  from the literature, and we find that the methodsâ€™ solutions replicate the behavior
  of the analytical solution provided in the literature. Following that demonstration,
  we highlight the relative advantages and disadvantages of each method and discuss
  potential future work for this line of research.
