  Game-Theoretic Analysis
abstractNote: Supremacy in armed conflict comes not merely from superiority in capability
  or numbers but from how assets are used, down to the maneuvers of individual vehicles
  and munitions. This document outlines a research plan focused on skirmish-level
  tactics to militarily relevant scenarios. Skirmish-level refers to both the size
  of the adversarial engagement -- generally one vs. one, two vs. one, and/or one
  vs. two -- as well as the fact that the goal or objective of each team is well-established.
  The problem areas include pursuit-evasion and target guarding, either of which may
  be considered as sub-problems within military missions such as air-to-air combat,
  suppression/defense of ground-based assets, etc. In most cases, the tactics considered
  are comprised of the control policy of the agents (i.e., their spatial maneuvers),
  but may also include role assignment (e.g, whether to act as a decoy or striker)
  as well as discrete decisions (e.g., whether to engage or retreat). Skirmish-level
  tactics are important because they can provide insight into how to approach larger
  scale conflicts (many vs. many, many objectives, many decisions). Machine learning
  approaches such as reinforcement learning and neural networks have been demonstrated
  to be capable of developing controllers for large teams of agents. However, the
  performance of these controllers compared to the optimal (or equilibrium) policies
  is generally unknown. Differential Game Theory provides the means to obtain a rigorous
  solution to relevant scenarios in the form of saddle-point equilibrium control policies
  and the min/max (or max/min) cost / reward in the case of zero-sum games. When the
  equilibrium control policies can be obtained analytically, they are suitable for
  onboard / real-time implementation. Some challenges associated with the classical
  Differential Game Theory approach are explored herein. These challenges arise mainly
  due to the presence of singularities, which may appear in even the simplest differential
  games. The utility of skirmish-level solutions is demonstrated in (i) the multiple
  pursuer, single evader differential games, (ii) multi-agent turret defense scenarios,
  and (iii) engage or retreat scenarios. In its culmination, this work contributes
  differential game and optimal control solutions to novel scenarios, numerical techniques
  for computing singular surfaces, approximations for computationally-intensive solutions,
  and techniques for addressing scenarios with multiple stages or outcomes.
