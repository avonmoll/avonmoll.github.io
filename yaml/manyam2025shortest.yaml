  Circle with
abstractNote: In this paper the shortest time strategy of turn- constrained vehicle
  for reaching a circle moving on a straight line is posed and solved. The shortest
  curvature constrained path to a circle is comprised of a left or right turning arc
  of minimum turn radius (L/R) and straight-line segment (S). An analysis of each
  of the candidate Dubins modes, L, R, LS, and RS is provided. Under the condition
  that the agent’s initial position is not on the path of the moving circle, we prove
  that the length of the shortest Dubins path to the circle is a continuous function
  of the position of the target center. Leveraging this continuity, we propose an
  algorithm that uses the bisection search and finds the time-optimal solution. A
  lower bound to the solution is obtained when the agent’s initial position lies on
  the path of the moving circle, and a heuristic approach is discussed for such instances.
