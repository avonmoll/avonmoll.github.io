  Evaders in the Border Defense
abstractNote: An interest in border defense, surveillance, and interdiction has recently
  increased for a variety of reasons related to issues of illegal immigration, terrorism,
  drug/human trafficking, and other potential threats. UAVs offer an attractive alternative
  to supporting and defending various threats at borders. This article applies a differential
  game to define a border defense scenario where one UAV (pursuer) seeks to capture
  two intruders (evaders) before they reach a designated border. The evaders can be
  UAVs, marine/ground vehicles, or human agents, but have a lower maximum speed than
  the pursuer throughout the game. Simple motion is assumed for the pursuer and evaders
  with complete state information shared across all agents.  The game is played within
  a rectangular area with a parallel top and bottom border of length L and left and
  right borders with a length of W, for a game aspect ratio of L/W. The value of the
  game is the minimum distance to the bottom border achieved by the evaders at any
  time before capture of both evaders. Within the region where the pursuer wins, the
  game of degree is explored and the optimal policy for both the evaders and pursuers
  is derived using geometric
