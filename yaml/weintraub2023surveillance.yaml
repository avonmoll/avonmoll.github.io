  Target
abstractNote: 'The maximum surveillance of a target which is holding course is considered,
  wherein an observer vehicle aims to maximize the time that a faster target remains
  within a fixed-range of the observer. This entails two coupled phases: an approach
  phase and observation phase. In the approach phase, the observer strives to make
  contact with the faster target, such that in the observation phase, the observer
  is able to maximize the time where the target remains within range. Using Pontryaginâ€™s
  Minimum Principle, the optimal control laws for the observer are found in closed-form.
  Example scenarios highlight various aspects of the engagement.'
