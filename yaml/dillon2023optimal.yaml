  Avoidance of Multiple Weapon
abstractNote: The work herein expresses an optimal control problem for an air vehicle
  to reach a desired location through two dynamic keep out zones. In today’s contested
  world, there are many instances where air vehicles are denied a portion of the airspace
  when trying to reach a desired target. Under these conditions the objective is to
  find the optimal route to the desired location while obeying path constraints. In
  this work, the path constraint is defined as the enemy’s ground weapon engagement
  zone, and is established in a way that simulates an anti-aircraft defense system.
  The vehicle’s objective is to reach the desired location in minimum time while completely
  avoiding the engagement zone. This optimal control problem is considered in the
  Cartesian plane, has a fixed final state, and free final time. The dynamics of the
  aircraft are a function of the aircraft’s velocity and heading. The velocity of
  the aircraft is assumed to be constant and the vehicle’s control is its heading
  rate. The engagement zone, which acts as a path constraint, is dynamic in that its
  effective range is a function of the engagement zone’s instantaneous line of sight
  angle and the aircraft’s instantaneous bearing angle. The desired final location
  is defined to be a point opposite the engagement zone from the aircraft’s initial
  location. Several scenarios are conducted to show path trajectories through multiple
  dynamic engagement zones. Results illustrate how aircraft dynamic maneuvers can
  minimize total flight time to a target while maintaining a safe distance from enemy
  threats. Further, while investigating multiple engagement zones, it is shown that
  an aircraft can maintain safe separation from multiple overlapping threats by manipulating
  relative bearing angles and the aircraft’s heading.
