  Arriving Attackers
abstractNote: 'We consider a variant of the target defense problem where a single
  defender is tasked to capture a sequence of incoming intruders. The intruders’ objective
  is to breach the target boundary without being captured by the defender. As soon
  as the current intruder breaches the target or gets captured by the defender, the
  next intruder appears at a random location on a fixed circle surrounding the target.
  Therefore, the defender’s final location at the end of the current game becomes
  its initial location for the next game. Thus, the players pick strategies that are
  advantageous for the current as well as for the future games. Depending on the information
  available to the players, each game is divided into two phases: partial information
  and full information phase. Under some assumptions on the sensing and speed capabilities,
  we analyze each agent’s strategy in both phases. We derive equilibrium strategies
  for both the players to optimize the capture percentage using the notions of engagement
  surface and capture circle. We quantify the percentage of capture for both finite
  and infinite sequences of incoming intruders.'
