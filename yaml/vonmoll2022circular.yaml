  Games
abstractNote: In this paper, the problem of guarding a circular target wherein the
  Defender(s) is constrained to move along its perimeter is posed and solved using
  a differential game theoretic approach. Both the one-Defender and two-Defender scenarios
  are analyzed and solved. The mobile Attacker seeks to reach the perimeter of the
  circular target, whereas the Defender(s) seeks to align itself with the Attacker,
  thereby ending the game. In the former case, the Attacker wins, and the Attacker
  and Defender play a zero sum differential game where the payoff/cost is the terminal
  angular separation. In the latter case, the Defender(s) wins, and the Attacker and
  Defender play a zero sum differential game where the cost/payoff is the Attackerâ€™s
  terminal distance to the target. This formulation is representative of a scenario
  in which the Attacker inflicts damage on the target as a function of its terminal
  distance. The state-feedback equilibrium strategies and Value functions for the
  Attacker-win and Defender(s)-win scenarios are derived for both the one- and two-Defender
  cases, thus providing a solution to the Game of Degree. Analytic expressions for
  the separating surfaces between the various terminal scenarios are derived, thus
  providing a solution to the Game of Kind.
