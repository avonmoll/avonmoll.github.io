  for UAV Persistent Visitation Problem
abstractNote: We employ a genetic algorithm approach to solving the persistent visitation
  problem for UAVs. The objective is to minimize the maximum weighted revisit time
  over all the sites in a cyclicly repeating walk. In general, the optimal length
  of the walk is not known, so this method (like the exact methods) assume some fixed
  length. Exact methods for solving the problem have recently been put forth, however,
  in the absence of additional heuristics, the exact method scales poorly for problems
  with more than 10 sites or so. By using a genetic algorithm, performance and computation
  time can be traded off depending on the application. The main contributions are
  a novel chromosome encoding scheme and genetic operators for cyclic walks which
  may visit sites more than once. Examples show that the performance is comparable
  to exact methods with better scalability.
