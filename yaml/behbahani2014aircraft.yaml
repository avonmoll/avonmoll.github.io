  and Opportunities for Distributed Intelligent
abstractNote: Modern propulsion system designers face challenges that require that
  aircraft and engine manufacturers improve performance as well as reduce the life-cycle
  cost (LCC). These improvements will require a more efficient, more reliable, and
  more advanced propulsion system. The concept of smart components is built around
  actively controlling the engine and the aircraft to operate optimally. Usage of
  smart components intelligently increases efficiency and system safety throughout
  the flight envelope, all while meeting environmental challenges. This approach requires
  an integration and optimization, both at the local level and the system level, to
  reduce cost. Interactions between the various subsystems must be understood through
  the use of modeling and simulation. This is accomplished by starting with individual
  subsystem models and combining them into a complete system model. Hierarchical,
  decentralized control reduces cost and risk by enabling integration and modularity.
  This process involves defining, developing, and validating against requirements
  for key integrated propulsion, power, and thermal management system capabilities.
