  a Dubins Vehicle
abstractNote: This paper considers the optimal control problem of steering a Dubins
  vehicle with a decaying speed that depends linearly on the turn-rate to a terminal
  point and heading with maximum kinetic energy. Pontryagin's Minimum Principle is
  applied and the extremals are identified as sequences of straight segments and spiral-shaped
  turns. A method is proposed to exactly  transcribe the continuous optimization into
  a series of finite dimensional optimizations; each of which solves for locally optimal
  extremal that satisfies the terminal condition. Next, an application of this path
  planning approach to gliding flight is examined. A technique is established to map
  the planar paths to three-dimensional trajectories for an aerodynamic glider model
  with angle-of-attack and bank-angle controls. The maximum kinetic energy obtained
  using the mapping is compared to a baseline glider guidance technique through numerical
  simulations.
