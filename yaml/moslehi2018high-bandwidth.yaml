  Sensors for High-Temperature Aerospace Applications
abstractNote: The insertion of advanced technologies into gas turbine engines is expected
  to reduce costs and improve performance. Engines will be getting smaller and hotter
  for efficiency reasons, requiring diverse types of sensors, in particular pressure
  and temperature sensors, with extended and enhanced performance. Emerging fiber-optic
  sensing approaches could provide a unique solution to surpassing the limitations
  and burden of conventional sensors. Two novel multiplexable fiber optic-based pressure
  sensor designs are discussed for high-temperature operations up to 1,800 °F and
  3,700 °F. These innovative sensor designs enable more direct measurements over long
  durations, resulting in higher accuracy and stability. These sensors could be used
  in ground test cells, in-flight control, and diagnostics and prognostic health management
  (PHM). Highly reliable all-optical sensor networking and interface designs with
  a high-speed, high-bandwidth fiber-optic backbone is also presented.
