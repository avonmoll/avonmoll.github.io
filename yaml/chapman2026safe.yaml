  of Range-Limited Pursuers
abstractNote: This paper examines the degree to which an evader seeking a safe and
  efficient path to a target location can benefit from increasing levels of knowledge
  regarding one or more range-limited pursuers seeking to intercept it. Unlike previous
  work, this research considers the time of flight of the pursuers actively attempting
  interception. It is shown that additional knowledge allows the evader to safely
  steer closer to the threats, shortening paths without accepting additional risk
  of capture. A control heuristic is presented, suitable for real time implementation,
  which capitalizes on all knowledge available to the evader.
