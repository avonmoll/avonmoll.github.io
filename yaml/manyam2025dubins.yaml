  and Field-of-View Constraints
abstractNote: This paper addresses a path planning problem for a turn-constrained
  vehicle equipped with a sensor that has a limited range and field-of-view (FOV).
  The vehicle is models by Dubins kinematics, and the objective is to determine the
  shortest path that reaches the target within the sensor’s range and lies in its
  FOV. The limited range of the sensor manifests as a constraint to reach a circle
  centered at target’s position and radius equal to sensor range. The field of view
  constraints are expressed as coupled constraints on terminal position and heading.
  Using Pontryagin’s minimum principle, we show that optimal solution could have at
  most two segments, a turn or a straight line for each segment. Straight line segments
  occur exclusively when the final position is located on the boundary of the target
  circle. Furthermore, we provide an analytical approach for computing optimal paths
  in scenarios where the optimality conditions lead to complex geometric configurations.
