  Game with N-Targets and
abstractNote: 'A two-player, Engage or Retreat (EoR) differential game is presented
  in which an attacker must choose whether to capture one of N static targets or retreat
  across a defined retreat boundary. Throughout the engagement, a defending player
  is capable of activating defensive assets located at each of the target locations.
  These defensive assets inflict a cost on the attacker as a function of distance
  and allow the defender to present a deterrent in an effort to persuade the attacker
  to elect retreat. The solution of the game is constructed by examining two related
  subproblems: the Game of Engagement (GoE) and the Optimal Constrained Retreat (OCR).
  Each subproblem examines a different combination of attacker termination strategies,
  capture vs retreat, and defender strategies, resist vs cooperate. When solving for
  the optimal constrained retreat strategy, a value function constraint is imposed
  on the retreat trajectory in order to ensure that the attacker does not maneuver
  into an advantageous position. Several solutions are examined to illustrate the
  types of behaviors found in the equilibrium game solutions.'
