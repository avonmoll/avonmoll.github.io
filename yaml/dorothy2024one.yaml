  for Many Pursuit-Evasion
abstractNote: This paper investigates obstacle-free simple motion pursuit-evasion
  problems where the pursuer is faster and game termination is point capture. It is
  well known that the interior of the Apollonius Circle (AC) is the evader's dominance
  region, however, it was unclear whether the evader could reach outside the initial
  AC without being captured. We construct a pursuit strategy that guarantees the capture
  of an evader within an arbitrarily close neighborhood of the initial AC. The pursuer
  strategy is derived by reformulating the game into a nonlinear control problem,
  and the guarantee holds against any admissible evader strategy. Our result implies
  that the evader can freely select the capture location, but only inside the initial
  AC. Therefore, a class of problems, including those where the payoff is determined
  solely based on the location of capture, are now trivial.
