  Target Under Sensing
abstractNote: This paper studies a heterogeneous three-agent pursuit-evasion scenario
  in which a sensor–attacker team attempts to capture an active target capable of
  changing its heading at fixed time intervals. The sensor has a limited sensing range,
  and the attacker must intercept the target before it escapes sensing. We formulate
  this problem as a game of kind and extend the optimal sensor and attacker strategies
  from prior work on passive targets to the active target setting. The sensor updates
  its heading in each interval by assuming that the target will keep its heading fixed
  for the rest of the engagement, while the attacker uses an Apollonius circle-based
  approach for minimum-time interception and updating its heading corresponding to
  the target heading in every interval. The main result of this letter is to show
  that the conditions for capture or escape of a passive target also extend to the
  case of an active targets. In particular, if the speed of the active target is less
  than a critical value – which is the same as for the case of passive targets from
  our prior work, then capture is guaranteed.
