  Differential Game with Role Selection
abstractNote: A scenario is considered in which two cooperative Attackers aim to infiltrate
  a circular target guarded by a Turret.  The engagement plays out in the two dimensional
  plane; the holonomic Attackers have the same speed and move with simple motion and
  the Turret is stationary, located at the target circle's center, and has a bounded
  turn rate.  When the Turret's look angle is aligned with an Attacker, that Attacker
  is neutralized.  In this paper, we focus on a region of the state space wherein
  only one of the Attackers is able to reach the target circle -- and even then, only
  with the help of its partner Attacker.  The Runner distracts the Turret and ends
  up being neutralized in order that the Penetrator can be guaranteed to hit the target
  circle.  We formulate the Turret-Runner-Penetrator scenario as a differential game
  over the Value of the subsequent game of min/max terminal angle which takes place
  between the Turret and Penetrator once the Runner has been neutralized.  The solution
  to the Game of Degree, including equilibrium Turret, Runner, and Penetrator strategies,
  as well as the Value function are given.  The case in which the Penetrator can reach
  the target before the Turret can neutralize the Runner is formulated and solved.  Finally,
  the assumption of a priori defined roles/goals is relaxed and the minimum of the
  solutions to the two fixed-role games is shown to be a Global Stackelberg Equilibrium.
