  with a Nonzero
abstractNote: This paper explores a multi-agent containment problem, where a fast
  evader, modeled having constant speed and using constant heading, attempts to escape
  a circular containment region that is orbited by a slower pursuer with a nonzero
  capture radius. The pursuer is constrained to move along the edge of the containment
  region and seeks to capture the evader. This paper presents an in-depth analysis
  of this pursuer-evader containment scenario. First, multiple types of capture conditions
  for a single- pursuer case are analyzed defining the worst-case initial position
  for the pursuer. Second, a parametric study is performed to demonstrate the effects
  of speed ratio, capture radius, and initial location of the evader. Finally, a reachability
  analysis is performed to investigate the viable escape headings and reachable regions
  by the evader. This work provides a foundation for the analysis of escape under
  more general evader inputs as well as a multiple-pursuer version of the scenario.
