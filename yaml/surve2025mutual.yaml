  Team for a Passive
abstractNote: We introduce a pursuit game played between a team of a sensor and an
  attacker and a mobile target in the unbounded Euclidean plane. The target is faster
  than the sensor, but slower than the attacker. The sensor’s objective is to keep
  the target within a sensing radius so that the attacker can capture the target,
  whereas the target seeks to escape by reaching beyond the sensing radius from the
  sensor without getting captured by the attacker. We assume that as long as the target
  is within the sensing radius from the sensor, the sensor-attacker team is able to
  measure the target’s instantaneous position and velocity. We pose and solve this
  problem as a game of kind in which the target uses an open-loop strategy (passive
  target). Aside from the novel formulation, our contributions are four-fold. First,
  we present optimal strategies for both the sensor and the attacker, according to
  their respective objectives. Specifically, we design a sensor strategy that maximizes
  the duration for which the target remains within its sensing range, while the attacker
  uses proportional navigation to capture the target. Second, we characterize the
  sensable region – the region in the plane in which the target remains within the
  sensing radius of the sensor during the game – and show that capture is guaranteed
  if and only if the Apollonius circle between the attacker and the target is fully
  contained within this region. Third, we derive a lower bound on the target’s speed
  below which capture is guaranteed, and an upper bound on the target speed above
  which there exists an escape strategy for the target, from an arbitrary initial
  orientation between the agents. Fourth, for a given initial orientation between
  the agents, we present a sharper upper bound on the target speed above which there
  exists an escape strategy for the target.
