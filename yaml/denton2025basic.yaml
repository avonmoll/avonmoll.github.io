  3-D
abstractNote: This paper presents a three-dimensional extension of the Basic Engagement
  Zone (BEZ) as a spherically capped cone, representing a threatâ€™s risk region for
  a fixed speed target aircraft. The threat is modeled as having a reachability region
  dictated by a sphere of fixed radius. The resulting three- dimensional BEZ shape
  at a fixed altitude is also analyzed, offering enhanced understanding for aircraft
  survivability.
