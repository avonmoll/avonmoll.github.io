  Vehicle with a
abstractNote: We formulate a novel planar motion planning problem for a Dubins-Laser
  system that consists of a Dubins vehicle with an attached controllable laser. The
  vehicle moves with unit speed and the laser, having a finite range, can rotate in
  a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction with a bounded angular rate. From an arbitrary
  initial position and orientation, the objective is to steer the system so that a
  given static target is within the range of the laser and the laser is oriented at
  it in minimum time. We characterize multiple properties of the optimal trajectory
  and establish that the optimal trajectory for the Dubins-laser system is one out
  of a total of 16 candidates. Finally, we provide numerical insights that illustrate
  the properties characterized in this work.
