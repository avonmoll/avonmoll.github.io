  Against Multiple Attackers
abstractNote: A scenario is considered where a coastline or border is coming under
  attack by two aircraft. The border is guarded by a faster defender bent on intercepting
  both aircraft in sequence. A differential game is formulated where the defender
  sequentially pursues both aircraft and tries to capture them as far as possible
  from the border. The two aircraft execute cooperative maneuvers and try to minimize
  their combined distance to the border at the moment when each one is intercepted
  by the defender. In this paper, the regular solution of this differential game is
  obtained and the game singular surfaces are identified.
