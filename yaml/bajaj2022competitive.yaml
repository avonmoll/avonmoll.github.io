  of Conical Environments
abstractNote: This work addresses a perimeter defense problem in a planar conical
  environment in which a single vehicle, having a finite capture radius, aims to defend
  a concentric perimeter from mobile intruders. The intruders are arbitrarily released
  at the circumference of the environment and move radially toward the perimeter with
  fixed speed. We present a competitive analysis approach to this problem by measuring
  the performance of multiple online algorithms for the vehicle against arbitrary
  inputs relative to an optimal offline algorithm that has access to all future inputs.
  In particular, we first establish a necessary condition on the parameter space to
  guarantee finite competitiveness of any algorithm and then characterize parameter
  regime in which one must expect a competitive ratio of at least 2. We then design
  and analyze three online algorithms and characterize parameter regimes for which
  they have finite competitive ratios. Specifically, our first two algorithms are
  provably 1, and 2-competitive, respectively, whereas our third algorithm exhibits
  a finite competitive ratio that depends on the problem parameters. Finally, we provide
  numerous parameter space plots providing insights into the relative performance
  of our algorithms.
