  Game
abstractNote: This paper considers a pursuit-evasion problem with two cooperative
  pursuers and one evader. The problem is posed as a zero-sum differential game where
  the evader aims at reaching a goal line which is protected by the pursuers. When
  reaching this goal is not possible, the evader strives to position itself as close
  as possible with respect to the goal line at the time of capture. The pursuers try
  to capture the evader as far as possible from the goal line. Leveraging differential
  game theory, state feedback strategies are both synthesized and verified in this
  paper. In addition, the Barrier surface that partitions the state space into two
  winning sets, one for the pursuer team and one for the evader, is obtained in analytical
  form. Under optimal play, the winning team is determined by evaluating the associated
  Barrier function.
