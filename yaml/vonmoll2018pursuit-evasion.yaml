  by Multiple Pursuers
abstractNote: In this paper, we extend the well-studied results of the two-pursuer,
  single-evader differential game to any number of pursuers. The main objective of
  this investigation is to exploit the benefits of cooperation amongst the pursuers
  in order to reduce the capture time of the evader. Computational complexity is a
  chief concern as this problem would need to be solved in an online fashion, e.g.
  in the case of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles. A new geometric approach to
  solving the game is introduced and analyzed, which changes the problem of optimizing
  over continuous domains to a discrete combinatoric optimization. While past efforts
  at solving multiple pursuer problems have suffered from the curse of dimensionality,
  the geometric algorithms put forth here are shown to be scalable. Categorization
  and removal of redundant pursuers is the primary means by which scalability is achieved.
  The solution of this problem serves as a stepping stone to more complex problems
  such as the M-pursuer N-evader differential game.
