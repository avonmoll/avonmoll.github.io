  a Non-Maneuvering Evader
abstractNote: This paper considers a three agent scenario consisting of a pursuer,
  evader, and a defender. The pursuerâ€™s objective is to capture the non-maneuvering
  evader in minimum time while a defender aims at keeping the pursuer inside his circular
  engagement zone for as long as possible; the pursuer is considered to be faster
  than both the evader and the defender.  Using the calculus of variations the optimal
  control problem for the defender which maximizes the amount of time that the pursuer
  is inside his area of effect is posed and solved. In the event that the evader is
  captured by the pursuer before the pursuer escapes the area of effect of the defender,
  some suboptimal strategies of the defender provide equivalent contact time. The
  derivation of the headings which the defender can take to maximally contact the
  pursuer is presented, along with examples which highlight the importance of the
  initial conditions of the engagement scenario.
