  Network System Reliability Modeling and
abstractNote: Next-generation integrated propulsion systems require reliable, robust,
  low-cost and high performance sensing systems beyond what is expected to be delivered
  by conventional sensor networks. Emerging fiber-optic sensor networks offer distinct
  advantages, including multiplexability, cybersecurity, inherent EMI/RFI immunity,
  high speed and bandwidth, and compatibility with the avionics environment. Ongoing
  development of a novel reliability analysis methodology to quantify sensor network
  reliability in harsh environments is discussed. Failure modes, mechanisms, and effects
  analysis (FMMEA) was performed for jet engine environments. System design and deployment
  guidelines were then developed based upon experience in sensor network deployments
  to harsh environments. Addressing this key technology gap, an integrated fiber-optic
  network reliability analysis technique based upon  predictive failure models is
  being developed via rigorous environmental testing of critical optical and optoelectronic
  components comprising the sensor network. The results of this effort are expected
  to empower propulsion system sensing and control network engineers to enhance design
  and deployment for reliability.
