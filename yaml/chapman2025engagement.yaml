  Constrained Pursuer
abstractNote: This work derives two basic engagement zone models, describing regions
  of potential risk or capture for a mobile vehicle by a pursuer. The pursuer is modeled
  having turn-constraints rather than simple motion. Turn-only (C-Paths) and turn-straight
  (CS-Paths) paths are considered for the pursuer of limited range. Following the
  derivation, a simulation of a vehicle avoiding the pursuer's engagement zone is
  provided.
