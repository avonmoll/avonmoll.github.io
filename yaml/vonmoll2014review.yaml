  Sensing Techniques
abstractNote: The exhaust gas temperature (EGT) is typically defined as the gas temperature
  at the exit of the turbine; the sensors used to measure this parameter are considered
  the most vulnerable elements of the entire turbine engine instrumentation. EGT measurement
  is considered a key parameter for optimizing fuel economy, diagnosis, and prognosis.
  The reason is that turbine blade temperature is a good indicator for normal life
  consumption of that blade. Currently, direct sensor measurements made on turbine
  modules are limited due to the extremely hot environment. Exhaust gas temperature
  (EGT) sensors located downstream from the highest temperature sections provide a
  means to roughly infer the temperatures seen by the turbine blades/disks. But these
  sensors, which themselves are subject to frequent failures, provide a fairly inaccurate
  indication of the actual metal temperature profiles. This is of particular importance
  for high performance military turbine engines where the margin between hot-section
  operating conditions and material limitations is shrinking. A future state is envisioned
  that would use emerging pyrometric, fiber optic, and laser-based sensing to accurately
  assess the condition and life usage of the hot section, on a blade-by-blade basis.
