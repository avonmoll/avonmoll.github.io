  that Resolves the Dilemma
abstractNote: The scope of this work is the well-known wall pursuit game which has
  been used in the literature to illustrate the existence of a singular surface (dispersal
  line) and the associated game dilemma. We derive an analytical expression for the
  value function of the game and use a hold time to derive the rate of change for
  the loss of the time to capture along the dispersal line. Then we resolve the dilemma
  along the dispersal line using actions defined by the saddle point of the rate of
  change for the loss. Finally, we analyze the same game in a version with a non-zero
  hold time and show that in that case, the actions from the dispersal line have to
  be applied not only on the dispersal line, but in a narrow band around it. To illustrate
  that, we use an example to compute the band around the line.
