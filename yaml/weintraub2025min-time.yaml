  Car from a
abstractNote: A turn constrained vehicle is initially located inside a polygon region
  and desires to escape in minimum time. First, the method of characteristics is used
  to describe the time-optimal strategies for reaching a line of infinite length.
  Next, the approach is extended to polygons constructed of a series of line segments.
  Using this construction technique, the min-time path to reach each edge is obtained;
  the resulting minimum of the set of optimal trajectories is then selected for escaping
  the polygon.
