  a Multiple-Pursuer Multiple-Evader Scenario
abstractNote: 'This paper considers an M-pursuer N-evader scenario involving virtual
  targets. The virtual targets serve as an intermediary target for the pursuers, allowing
  the pursuers to delay their final assignment to the evaders. However, upon reaching
  the virtual target, the pursuers must decide which evader to capture. It is assumed
  that there are more pursuers than evaders and that the pursuers are faster than
  the evaders. The objective is two-part: first, assign each pursuer to virtual target
  and evader such that the the pursuer team’s energy is minimized, and second, choose
  the the virtual targets’ locations for this minimization problem. The approach taken
  is to consider the Apollonius geometry between each pursuer’s virtual target location
  and each evader. Using the constructed Apollonius circles, the pursuer’s travel
  distance and maneuver at a virtual target are obtained. These metrics serve as a
  gauge for the total energy required to capture a particular evader and are used
  to solve the joint virtual target selection and pursuer-evader assignment problem.
  This paper provides a mathematical definition of this problem, the solution approach
  taken, and an example.'
