  Differential Games
abstractNote: In this paper an N-pursuer vs. M-evader team conflict is studied. The
  differential game of border defense is addressed and we focus on the game of degree
  in the region of the state space where the pursuers are able to win. This work extends
  classical differential game theory to simultaneously address weapon assignments
  and multi-player pursuit-evasion scenarios. Saddle-point strategies that provide
  guaranteed performance for each team regardless of the actual strategies implemented
  by the opponent are devised. The players' optimal strategies require the co-design
  of cooperative optimal assignments and optimal guidance laws. A representative measure
  of performance is proposed and the Value function of the game is obtained. It is
  shown that the Value function is continuous, continuously differentiable, and that
  it satisfies the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation - the curse of dimensionality is
  overcome and the optimal strategies are obtained. The cases of N=M and N>M are considered.
  In the latter case, cooperative guidance strategies are also developed in order
  for the pursuers to exploit their numerical advantage. This work provides a foundation
  to formally analyze complex and high-dimensional conflicts between teams of N pursuers
  and M evaders by means of differential game theory.
