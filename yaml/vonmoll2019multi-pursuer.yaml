  Game: A Geometric Approach'
abstractNote: We consider a general pursuit-evasion differential game with three or
  more pursuers and a single evader, all with simple motion. It is shown that traditional
  means of differential game analysis is difficult for this scenario. But simple motion
  and min-max time to capture plus the two-person extension to Pontryagin's maximum
  principle imply straight-line motion at maximum speed which forms the basis of the
  solution using a geometric approach. Safe evader paths and policies are defined
  which guarantee the evader can reach its destination without getting captured by
  any of the pursuers, provided its destination satisfies some constraints. A linear
  program is used to characterize the solution and subsequently the saddle-point is
  computed numerically. We replace the numerical procedure with a more analytical
  geometric approach based on Voronoi diagrams after observing a pattern in the numerical
  results. The solutions derived are open-loop optimal, meaning the strategies are
  a saddle-point equilibrium in the open-loop sense.
