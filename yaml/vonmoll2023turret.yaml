  Game
abstractNote: In this paper, a zero-sum differential game is formulated and solved
  in which a mobile Evader seeks to escape from within a circle at whose origin lies
  a stationary, turn-constrained Turret. The scenario is a variant of the famous Lady
  in the Lake game in which the shore-constrained Pursuer has been replaced with the
  Turret. As in the former, it is assumed that the Turret's maximum angular rate is
  greater than the linear velocity of the Evader. Since two outcomes are possible,
  a Game of Kind arises - either the Evader wins by reaching the perimeter of the
  circle, or the Turret wins by aligning with the latter's position. A barrier surface
  partitions the state space into two regions corresponding to these two outcomes
  and a Game of Degree is solved within each region. The solutions to the Games of
  Degree are comprised of the Value functions (i.e., the equilibrium value of the
  cost/utility as a function of the state) and the saddle-point equilibrium control
  policies for the two players. Like the Lady in the Lake game, the equilibrium policy
  of the Evader is not uniquely deâ€€ned where it has angular rate advantage over the
  Turret. Unlike the Lady in the Lake game, the losing region for the Evader is present
  for all speed ratios, and there is an additional semi-permeable surface separating
  center- and shore-bound Evader trajectories. The solution depends heavily upon the
  speed ratio of the agents; in particular, there are two speed ratio regimes with
  distinctive solution structures.
