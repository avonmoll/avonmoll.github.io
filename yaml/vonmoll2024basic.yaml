abstractNote: This paper establishes a concise definition for an Engagement Zone which
  describes a region of space for which a Mobile Agent must alter its current motion
  strategy or otherwise risk engaging with a known Threat. In the event of an engagement,
  the Mobile Agent may have to actively evade the Threat in order to guarantee survival.
  Provided the Engagement Zone definition, several fundamental engagement models are
  described and their corresponding Engagement Zones are derived. In each of the engagement
  models, the Mobile Agent is treated as an Evader; they include pursuit-evasion against
  a range-limited Pursuer moving with simple motion and faster speed, a variation
  in which the Pursuer is slower, and a turret-evasion scenario against a range-limited,
  turn-rate-limited Turret. The slow Pursuer Engagement Zone is applied to a path
  planning scenario wherein the Mobile Agent must reach a desired target in minimum
  time while navigating outside the dynamically changing Engagement Zone. Numerical
  results demonstrate the advantage of Engagement Zone-based navigation over other
  path plans based on circumnavigation.
