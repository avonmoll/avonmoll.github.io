  Game: Information Limiting Strategy'
abstractNote: Can deception exist in differential games? We provide a case study for
  a Turret-Attacker differential game, where two Attackers seek to score points by
  reaching a target region while a Turret tries to minimize the score by aligning
  itself with the Attackers before they reach the target. In contrast to the original
  problem solved with complete information, we assume that the Turret only has partial
  information about the maximum speed of the Attackers. We investigate whether there
  is any incentive for the Attackers to move slower than their maximum speed in order
  to “deceive” the Turret into taking suboptimal actions. We first describe the existence
  of a dilemma that the Turret may face. Then we derive a set of initial conditions
  from which the Attackers can force the Turret into a situation where it must take
  a guess.
