  Proximal Sensing of
abstractNote: This work considers a two-actor scenario of a faster, unmanned turn-constrained
  pursuer with an engagement zone (EZ) and a non-maneuvering mobile evader. The pursuer
  aims to capture an evader with a circular EZ. The pursuer’s EZ is dynamic and shifts
  as a function of the evader’s velocity vector magnitude and direction. Using nonlinear
  optimal control techniques, the optimal trajectory and minimum time to engage the
  evader are determined for various pursuer initial headings and positions through
  MATLAB simulation. The results build a control strategy given the scenario, with
  analytic solution validation. Results lay a foundation to model pursuer-evader capture
  scenarios with a dynamic EZ, leading to general guidelines for real-time control
  strategies. Finally, an algorithm to find a dispersal surface in any pursuer/evader
  scenario establishes a comparison angle for the pursuer to guarantee optimal turn
  direction to engage the evader.
