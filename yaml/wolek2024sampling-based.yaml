  Planning Around Dynamic Engagement Zones
abstractNote: Existing methods for avoiding dynamic engagement zones (EZs) and minimizing
  risk leverage the calculus of variations to obtain optimal paths. While such methods
  are deterministic, they scale poorly as the number of engagement zones increases.
  Furthermore, optimal-control based strategies are sensitive to initial guesses and
  often converge to local, rather than global, minima. This paper presents a novel
  sampling-based approach to obtain a feasible flight plan for a Dubins vehicle to
  reach a desired location in a bounded operating region in the presence of a large
  number of engagement zones. The dynamic EZs are coupled to the vehicle dynamics
  through its heading angle. Thus, the dynamic two-dimensional obstacles in the (x,
  y) plane can be transformed into three-dimensional static obstacles in a lifted
  (x, y, ψ) space. This insight is leveraged in the formulation of a Rapidly-exploring
  Random Tree (RRT∗) algorithm. The algorithm is evaluated with a Monte Carlo experiment
  that randomizes EZ locations to characterize the success rate and average path length
  as a function of the number of EZs and as the computation time made available to
  the planner is increased.
