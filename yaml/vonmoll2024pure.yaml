  a Circular
abstractNote: This investigation seeks to obtain estimates on the intercept time associated
  with a fast Pursuer implementing Pure Pursuit against a Target whose trajectory
  is a circular arc. The analytical solution of the kinematic equations of motion
  is not feasible and thus the baseline approach for computing the intercept time
  is numerical simulation, i.e., numerical integration of the kinematics. This method
  can obtain the intercept time in (essentially) real time for a single Pursuer against
  a single Target. Here, the goal is to estimate the intercept time using orders of
  magnitude less computational time. Although not explicitly explored in this work,
  the purpose of such approximations is to make feasible the rapid evaluation of Pursuer-to-Target
  assignments in a massive many-on-many engagement scenario wherein the intercept
  time may be a key measure. Several approximation methods are proposed here and their
  merits (or lack thereof) are demonstrated through simulation. Ultimately, assuming
  the Target is not actually turning may be suitable when its turn radius is relatively
  large, while assuming intercept occurs at the closest point on the turn circle may
  be suitable when its turn radius is relatively small.
