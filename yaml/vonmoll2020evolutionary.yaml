  Predation Strategies
abstractNote: In this paper a scenario is considered in which a group of predators
  cooperate to maximize the number of prey captures over a finite time horizon on
  a two-dimensional plane. The emphasis is on developing predator strategies, and
  thus the behavior of the prey agents is fixed to a Boids-like flocking model which
  incorporates avoidance of nearby predators. At each time instant, the predators
  have control authority over their heading angle; however, we restrict the headings
  to be governed by one of five different pre-specified behaviors. No communication
  occurs between the predator agents - each agent determines its own control without
  knowledge of what the other predators will implement; thus, the predator strategies
  are fully decentralized. The full state space of the system is collapsed to a set
  of features which is independent of the number of prey. An evolutionary algorithm
  is used to evolve an anchor point controller wherein the anchor point lies in the
  feature space and has a particular predator behavior associated, thus providing
  a candidate solution to the question of "what to do when". The two predator case
  is the focus in this work, although the ideas could be applied to larger groups
  of predators. The strategies resulting from the evolutionary algorithm favor aiming
  at the nearest prey mostly, and also avoiding having the predators getting too close
  and then pursuing the same prey. Thus useless behaviors are generally not present
  among the elite at the end of the evolutionary process.
