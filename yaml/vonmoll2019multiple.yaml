  Border Defense Differential Game
abstractNote: Ensuring border security against potential threats has been a long standing
  problem and it becomes much more challenging for land borders due to its long distances
  coupled with terrain variations. In this paper, we consider a scenario in which
  a team of UAVs (the pursuers)  attempt to prevent an intruder ground vehicle (the
  evader) from escaping through the border. The ground intruderâ€™s presence is made
  known by a laser fence positioned inside the border. Upon detection, the UAVs are
  activated and given the objective to cooperatively capture the intruder. We formulate
  the scenario as a zero-sum differential game whereupon all agents exhibit simple
  motion and the pursuers have a speed advantage. For cases where capture inside the
  border is possible, the payoff/cost for the pursuers/evader is the distance from
  capture to the border. The solution to the game is derived based on the geometric
  properties of the game and verified for the single pursuer case with a border comprised
  of straight-line segments. This game may contain a dispersal surface which has interesting
  practical consequences when the optimal strategies are applied in discrete time.
