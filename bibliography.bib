  abstract = {The following is a well known pursuit problem: n bugs are at rest at the vertices of a regular polygon. At a certain instant each bug starts crawling towards its neighbour on the right with a constant speed, always altering its course so as to be headed directly towards its neighbour. How long does it take for the bugs to meet at the center of the polygon and what paths do they trace out in getting there? The earliest reference I could find to this problem was in a collection of mathematical puzzles edited by L.A.Graham. A more recent reference to it occurs in the amusing and informative collection of geometrical curiosities by David Wells. The ‚Äún-bug‚Äù problem was also discussed briefly in two of Martin Gardner‚Äôs columns in Scientific American. The cover of the July 65 issue of that magazine shows the equiangular spirals traced out by four bugs as they ‚Äúsquare dance‚Äù their way towards their tryst at the centre.},

@article{aliyev2023geometric,
  abstract = {In the paper, some geometric properties of the plane interception curve defined by a nonlinear ordinary differential equation are discussed. Its parametric representation is used to find the limits of some triangle elements associated with the curve. These limits have some connections with the lemniscate constants A,B and Gauss's constant G, which were used to compare with the classical pursuit curve. The analogous spherical geometry problem is solved using a spherical curve defined by the Gudermannian function. It is shown that the results agree with the angle-preserving property of Mercator and Stereographic projections. The Mercator and Stereographic projections also reveal the symmetry of this curve with respect to Spherical and Logarithmic Spirals. The geometric properties of the spherical curve are proved in two ways, analytically and using a lemma about spherical angles. A similar lemma for the planar case is also mentioned. The paper shows symmetry/asymmetry between the spherical and planar cases and the derivation of the properties of these curves as limiting cases of some plane and spherical geometry results.},

@article{vonmoll2024complete,
  abstract = {In the Lady in the Lake scenario, a mobile agent, ùêø, is pitted against an agent, ùëÄ, who is constrained to move along the perimeter of a circle. ùêø is assumed to begin inside the circle and wishes to escape to the perimeter with some finite angular separation from ùëÄ at the perimeter. This scenario has, in the past, been formulated as a zerosum differential game wherein ùêø seeks to maximize terminal separation and ùëÄ seeks to minimize it. Its solution is well-known. However, there is a large portion of the state space for which the canonical solution does not yield a unique equilibrium strategy. This paper provides such a unique strategy by solving an auxiliary zero-sum differential game. In the auxiliary differential game, ùêø seeks to reach a point opposite of ùëÄ at a radius for which their maximum angular speeds are equal (i.e., the antipodal point). ùêø wishes to minimize the time to reach this point while ùëÄ wishes to maximize it. The solution of the auxiliary differential game is comprised of a Focal Line, a Universal Line, and their tributaries. The Focal Line tributaries‚Äô equilibrium strategy for ùêø is semi-analytic, while the Universal Line tributaries‚Äô equilibrium strategy is obtained in closed form.},

  abstract = {Recent research has shown that supervised learning can be an effective tool for designing optimal feedback controllers for high-dimensional nonlinear dynamic systems. But the behavior of these neural network (NN) controllers is still not well understood. In this paper we use numerical simulations to demonstrate that typical test accuracy metrics do not effectively capture the ability of an NN controller to stabilize a system. In particular, some NNs with high test accuracy can fail to stabilize the dynamics. To address this we propose two NN architectures which locally approximate a linear quadratic regulator (LQR). Numerical simulations confirm our intuition that the proposed architectures reliably produce stabilizing feedback controllers without sacrificing optimality. In addition, we introduce a preliminary theoretical result describing some stability properties of such NN-controlled systems.},

In the event of an engagement, the Mobile Agent may have to actively evade the Threat in order to guarantee survival. Provided the Engagement Zone definition, several fundamental engagement models are described and their corresponding Engagement Zones are derived. In each of the engagement models, the Mobile Agent is treated as an Evader; they include pursuit-evasion against a range-limited Pursuer moving with simple motion and faster speed, a variation in which the Pursuer is slower, and a turret-evasion scenario against a range-limited, turn-rate-limited Turret. The slow Pursuer Engagement Zone is applied to a path planning scenario wherein the Mobile Agent must reach a desired target in minimum time while navigating outside the dynamically changing Engagement Zone. Numerical results demonstrate the advantage of Engagement Zone-based navigation over other path plans based on circumnavigation.},

@article{patil2023risk-minimizing,
  abstract = {This paper addresses a continuous-time risk-minimizing two-player zero-sum stochastic differential game (SDG), in which each player aims to minimize its probability of failure. Failure occurs in the event when the state of the game enters into predefined undesirable domains, and one player's failure is the other's success. We derive a sufficient condition for this game to have a saddle-point equilibrium and show that it can be solved via a Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) partial differential equation (PDE) with Dirichlet boundary condition. Under certain assumptions on the system dynamics and cost function, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the saddle-point of the game. We provide explicit expressions for the saddle-point policies which can be numerically evaluated using path integral control. This allows us to solve the game online via Monte Carlo sampling of system trajectories. We implement our control synthesis framework on two classes of risk-minimizing zero-sum SDGs: a disturbance attenuation problem and a pursuit-evasion game. Simulation studies are presented to validate the proposed control synthesis framework.},

@article{comandur2023desensitization,
  abstract = {Desensitization addresses safe optimal planning under parametric uncertainties by providing sensitivity function-based risk measures. This paper expands upon the existing work on desensitization to address safe planning for a class of two-player differential games. In the proposed game, parametric uncertainties correspond to variations in a vector of model parameters about its nominal value. The two players in the proposed formulation are assumed to have information about the nominal value of the parameter vector. However, only one of the players is assumed to have complete knowledge of parametric variation, creating a form of information asymmetry in the proposed game. The lack of knowledge regarding the parametric variations is expected to result in state constraint violations for the player with an information disadvantage. In this regard, a desensitized feedback strategy that provides safe trajectories is proposed for the player with incomplete information. The proposed feedback strategy is evaluated in instances involving one pursuer and one evader with an uncertain dynamic obstacle, where the pursuer is assumed to know only the nominal value of the obstacle's speed. At the same time, the evader knows the obstacle's true speed, and also the fact that the pursuer possesses only the nominal value. Subsequently, deceptive strategies are proposed for the evader, who has an information advantage, and these strategies are assessed against the pursuer's desensitized strategy.},

Finally, a reachability analysis is performed to investigate the viable escape headings and reachable regions by the evader.

@misc{weintraub2024deterministic,
  abstract = {Previous methods for avoiding dynamic engagement zones leverage the calculus of variations to obtain optimal path plans for avoiding risk and reaching a desired target location [1,2]. While this method is deterministic; it scales poorly as the number of engagement zones increases. Furthermore, it is inherently sensitive to initial guesses and finding local minimums can be problematic. This talk presents a novel approach that uses deterministic approaches to obtain a set of feasible flight plans for reaching the desired destination and reports when no such plan exists. Furthermore, it uses an efficient scheme for feeding initial guesses to a nonlinear program solver that provides flyable path plans that mitigate risk. Lastly, a tool is developed that measures the risk of the flight path for avoiding a large field of engagement zones, providing useful information to improve battle management.
The solution process begins with using the location of each weapon engagement zone and associated model to obtain a Voronoi partition of the environment. This partitioning is used to construct a feasibility graph signifying navigation through each pair of weapon engagement zones. Once constructed each edge of the graph borders two opposing weapon engagement zones for which the target vehicle aims to navigate between. If the pair of engagement zones can not be penetrated due to the distance and size of those zones; then the associated edge of the graph is deleted. This process is iteratively performed until each edge has been evaluated. Upon completion of the feasibility graph, path plans are attained using graph-based search to minimize the time of arrival. Next, the provided solution is fed to a nonlinear program solver that smooths the solution or solutions from the feasibility path according to the vehicle dynamics. The resulting solutions are analyzed through a simplified simulation to assess risk and time of arrival. 
Presented are the methods used to solve this navigational problem, results of the simulated trajectories, and future research directions.

@misc{milutinovic2024stochastic,
  abstract = {Description: Recent efforts in planning paths for a vehicle around dynamic engagement zones have been based upon optimal control solved via nonlinear program comprised of a pseudospectral direct collocation of the dynamics and constraints. The engagement zone(s) rotate and scale based upon the position and aspect angle of the vehicle, respectively. Initially, the problem setup was based upon a vehicle navigating around a stationary, gimballed threat to reach a specified goal position; the entire engagement took place on a 2D plane [1]. As a follow-on effort, two dynamic engagement zones were considered along with an added vehicle turning-rate constraint [2]. In all of these works, the solution consisted of a single optimal trajectory associated with a particular initial condition. In this presentation, three extensions are considered and demonstrated: 1) stochasticity via the inclusion of a Wiener process (Brownian motion) in the dynamics, 2) computation of an optimal feedback control law, and 3) multiple engagement zones (even beyond 2). The stochastic process may represent uncertainty due to wind, other environmental factors, or position measurement errors. In the case of a single engagement zone the stochastic process may represent the vehicle‚Äôs uncertainty about the location of the engagement zone. Regarding the feedback control law, this is a much more powerful result than a single path plan as it requires that the control law be computed once, a priori, and can then be used for any position in the state space, whereas the existing path plan-based solutions require re-computation for each new position in the state space. Having the feedback control law and Value function everywhere is also illustrative of the overall behavior of optimal trajectories ‚Äì e.g., some optimal trajectories fly around while others fly between neighboring engagement zones. Lastly, the methodology can be applied to larger numbers of engagement zones. When based on Value iteration [3], the Value function computation scales at least sub-exponentially with the number of engagement zones.

@inproceedings{vonmoll2024pure,
  abstract = {This investigation seeks to obtain estimates on the intercept time associated with a fast Pursuer implementing Pure Pursuit against a Target whose trajectory is a circular arc. The analytical solution of the kinematic equations of motion is not feasible and thus the baseline approach for computing the intercept time is numerical simulation, i.e., numerical integration of the kinematics. This method can obtain the intercept time in (essentially) real time for a single Pursuer against a single Target. Here, the goal is to estimate the intercept time using orders of magnitude less computational time. Although not explicitly explored in this work, the purpose of such approximations is to make feasible the rapid evaluation of Pursuer-to-Target assignments in a massive many-on-many engagement scenario wherein the intercept time may be a key measure. Several approximation methods are proposed here and their merits (or lack thereof) are demonstrated through simulation. Ultimately, assuming the Target is not actually turning may be suitable when its turn radius is relatively large, while assuming intercept occurs at the closest point on the turn circle may be suitable when its turn radius is relatively small.},

@inproceedings{weintraub2024virtual,
  abstract = {This paper considers an M-pursuer N-evader scenario involving virtual targets. The virtual targets serve as an intermediary target for the pursuers, allowing the pursuers to delay their final assignment to the evaders. However, upon reaching the virtual target, the pursuers must decide which evader to capture. It is assumed that there are more pursuers than evaders and that the pursuers are faster than the evaders. The objective is two-part: first, assign each pursuer to virtual target and evader such that the the pursuer team‚Äôs energy is minimized, and second, choose the the virtual targets‚Äô locations for this minimization problem. The approach taken is to consider the Apollonius geometry between each pursuer‚Äôs virtual target location and each evader. Using the constructed Apollonius circles, the pursuer‚Äôs travel distance and maneuver at a virtual target are obtained. These metrics serve as a gauge for the total energy required to capture a particular evader and are used to solve the joint virtual target selection and pursuer-evader assignment problem. This paper provides a mathematical definition of this problem, the solution approach taken, and an example.},

The pursuit team aims to protect the goal region from the evasion team by cooperatively capturing the evaders which start from the play region and strive to enter the goal region. We provide a selective overview of algorithms and theoretical results for multiplayer reach-avoid differential games. Specifically, we focus on point mass holonomic players that can move freely in the game region and have simple motions as Rufus Isaacs states. We describe how the challenges due to high-dimensional continuous joint action and state spaces, as well as complex cooperations and competitions among players, can be properly resolved by a combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis of small-scale games and optimal task allocation. We finally point out the limitations of the current works and identify fruitful future research directions on theoretical studies of multiplayer reach-avoid differential games.</jats:p>},

In this paper, a Targets-Attackers-Defenders (TADs) game that includes an attacking team with [Formula: see text] Attackers, a target team with [Formula: see text] targets and a defending team with [Formula: see text] Defenders is considered. In this game, the players within each team cooperate with each other, and both cooperation and confrontation between the teams ensue. The defending team cooperates with the target team against the attacking team. The attacking team aims to capture [Formula: see text] Targets. The defending team protects [Formula: see text] Targets by intercepting Attackers or rendezvousing with Targets. We present a maximum matching algorithm considering both confrontation and cooperation by using relative distance and velocity parameters, and transform the TADs problem into a real-time target-assignment problem with strong confrontation. Finally, we propose an improved basic variable neighborhood search algorithm to solve the target-assignment problem and give the optimal dynamical strategy for each player.},

@thesis{carr2017optimal,
  abstract = {Optimal control theory is applied to the study of missile evasion, particularly in the case of a single pursuing missile versus a single evading aircraft. It is proposed to divide the evasion problem into two phases, where the primary considerations are energy and maneuverability, respectively. Traditional evasion tactics are well documented for use in the maneuverability phase. To represent the first phase dominated by energy management, the optimal control problem may be posed in two ways, as a fixed final time problem with the objective of maximizing the final distance between the evader and pursuer, and as a free final time problem with the objective of maximizing the final time when the missile reaches some capture distance away from the evader. These two optimal control problems are studied under several different scenarios regarding assumptions about the pursuer. First, a suboptimal control strategy, proportional navigation, is used for the pursuer. Second, it is assumed that the pursuer acts optimally, requiring the solution of a two-sided optimal control problem, otherwise known as a differential game. The resulting trajectory is known as a minimax, and it can be shown that it accounts for uncertainty in the pursuer‚Äôs control strategy. Finally, a pursuer whose motion and state are uncertain is studied in the context of Receding Horizon Control and Real Time Optimal Control. The results highlight how updating the optimal control trajectory reduces the uncertainty in the resulting miss distance.},

This minimum-time escape problem arises in marine, aerial, and ground robotics in situations where a safety region has been violated and must be exited before a potential negative consequence occurs (e.g., a collision). Using the tools of nonlinear optimal control theory, we show that a surprisingly simple closed-form feedback control law solves this minimum-time escape problem, and that the minimum-time paths have an elegant geometric interpretation.},

@misc{lee2022solutions,
  abstract = {This paper addresses a target-guarding differential game involving a single attacker, a group of faster defenders, and a convex target set. The goal of the defenders is to guard the target set, which is assumed to be a convex subset of R^n, from the attacker who attempts to reach the same set. In contrast to standard geometric formulations of this type of problems in the literature, we propose a new solution approach based on parametric optimization. In the proposed approach, the high- dimensional game is reduced into a parametric convex program, whose parameter corresponds to the state of the game and its objective is to find the capture point that determines the optimal policies of the players. The solution of this program is proven to be the unique fixed point of the composite projection operator associated with the feasible set of the program and the target set. An algorithm to find the latter solution is presented. We further show that, under certain conditions, the value function of the program is continuously differentiable and satisfies the Hamilton- Jacobi-Isaacs equation, thereby verifying its equivalence with the Value function of the game. Lastly, we highlight the effectiveness of our approach by means of numerical simulations.},

@article{bajaj2023competitive,
  abstract = {We consider perimeter defense problem in a planar conical environment with two cooperative heterogeneous defenders, i.e., a turret and a mobile vehicle, that seek to defend a concentric perimeter against mobile intruders. Arbitrary numbers of intruders are released at the circumference of the environment at arbitrary time instants and locations. Upon release, they move radially inwards with fixed speed towards the perimeter. The defenders are heterogeneous in terms of their motion and capture capabilities. Specifically, the turret has a finite engagement range and can only turn (clockwise or anti-clockwise) in the environment with fixed angular rate whereas, the vehicle has a finite capture radius and can move in any direction with unit speed. We present a competitive analysis approach to this perimeter defense problem by measuring the performance of multiple cooperative online algorithms for the defenders against arbitrary inputs, relative to an optimal offline algorithm that has information about the entire input sequence in advance. Specifically, we establish necessary conditions on the parameter space to guarantee finite competitiveness of any online algorithm. We then design and analyze four cooperative online algorithms and characterize parameter regimes in which they have finite competitive ratios. In particular, our first two algorithms are 1-competitive in specific parameter regimes, our third algorithm exhibits different competitive ratios in different regimes of problem parameters, and our fourth algorithm is 1.5-competitive in specific parameter regimes. Finally, we provide multiple numerical plots in the parameter space to reveal additional insights into the relative performance of our algorithms.},

@article{dillon2023optimal,
  abstract = {The work herein expresses an optimal control problem for an air vehicle to reach a desired location through two dynamic keep out zones. In today‚Äôs contested world, there are many instances where air vehicles are denied a portion of the airspace when trying to reach a desired target. Under these conditions the objective is to find the optimal route to the desired location while obeying path constraints. In this work, the path constraint is defined as the enemy‚Äôs ground weapon engagement zone, and is established in a way that simulates an anti-aircraft defense system. The vehicle‚Äôs objective is to reach the desired location in minimum time while completely avoiding the engagement zone. This optimal control problem is considered in the Cartesian plane, has a fixed final state, and free final time. The dynamics of the aircraft are a function of the aircraft‚Äôs velocity and heading. The velocity of the aircraft is assumed to be constant and the vehicle‚Äôs control is its heading rate. The engagement zone, which acts as a path constraint, is dynamic in that its effective range is a function of the engagement zone‚Äôs instantaneous line of sight angle and the aircraft‚Äôs instantaneous bearing angle. The desired final location is defined to be a point opposite the engagement zone from the aircraft‚Äôs initial location. Several scenarios are conducted to show path trajectories through multiple dynamic engagement zones. Results illustrate how aircraft dynamic maneuvers can minimize total flight time to a target while maintaining a safe distance from enemy threats. Further, while investigating multiple engagement zones, it is shown that an aircraft can maintain safe separation from multiple overlapping threats by manipulating relative bearing angles and the aircraft‚Äôs heading.},

@article{vonmoll2023turret,
  abstract = {In this paper, a zero-sum differential game is formulated and solved in which a mobile Evader seeks to escape from within a circle at whose origin lies a stationary, turn-constrained Turret. The scenario is a variant of the famous Lady in the Lake game in which the shore-constrained Pursuer has been replaced with the Turret. As in the former, it is assumed that the Turret's maximum angular rate is greater than the linear velocity of the Evader. Since two outcomes are possible, a Game of Kind arises - either the Evader wins by reaching the perimeter of the circle, or the Turret wins by aligning with the latter's position. A barrier surface partitions the state space into two regions corresponding to these two outcomes and a Game of Degree is solved within each region. The solutions to the Games of Degree are comprised of the Value functions (i.e., the equilibrium value of the cost/utility as a function of the state) and the saddle-point equilibrium control policies for the two players. Like the Lady in the Lake game, the equilibrium policy of the Evader is not uniquely de‚ÄÄned where it has angular rate advantage over the Turret. Unlike the Lady in the Lake game, the losing region for the Evader is present for all speed ratios, and there is an additional semi-permeable surface separating center- and shore-bound Evader trajectories. The solution depends heavily upon the speed ratio of the agents; in particular, there are two speed ratio regimes with distinctive solution structures.},

@article{bajaj2024multi-vehicle,
  abstract = {We consider a perimeter defense problem in a planar conical environment in which M identical vehicles, each having a finite capture radius, seek to defend a concentric perimeter from mobile intruders. The intruders are released at the circumference of the environment at arbitrary times and in any number. Upon release, each intruder moves radially toward the perimeter with fixed speed. We provide a worst-case analysis of this problem. Specifically, we present a competitive analysis approach to this problem by measuring the performance of decentralized and cooperative online algorithms for the vehicles against arbitrary inputs, relative to an optimal offline algorithm that has information about entire intruder release sequence in advance. In particular, apart from the minimum number of vehicles required to capture all intruders, we establish a necessary condition on the parameter space to guarantee finite competitive- ness of any algorithm. We then design and analyze three decen- tralized and two cooperative online algorithms and characterize parameter regimes in which they have finite competitive ratios. Specifically, our first two decentralized algorithms are provably 1, and 2-competitive, respectively, whereas our third decentralized algorithm exhibit different competitive ratios in different regimes of problem parameters. Similarly, our first cooperative algorithm is 1.5-competitive and our second cooperative algorithm exhibits different competitive ratios in different regimes of problem parameters. We then provide multiple numerical plots in the parameter space to reveal additional insights into the relative performance of our algorithms and discuss an extension to the case of heterogeneous vehicles.},

We present an online and an offline approach to this optimal problem. Specifically, for the offline approach, we establish that for general parameter regimes, this problem is equivalent to solving a Travelling Repairperson Problem with Time Windows (TRP- TW). We then identify specific parameter regimes in which there is a polynomial time algorithm that maximizes the number of intruders captured. For the online approach we present a competitive analysis technique in which we establish a fundamental guarantee on the existence of at best (N ‚àí 1)- competitive algorithms and design two online algorithms that are provably 1 and 2-competitive in specific parameter regimes.},

@article{coates2017optimal,
  abstract = {The optimal control of a Dubins car endowed with a circular or a line segment capture set is considered and the connection to their Homicidal Chauffeur differential game (HCDG) analogues is discussed. The capture set endowed Dubins cars are tasked to reach a stationary target point in minimum time. The solutions to the Dubins car optimal control problems (DCOCP) are similar to the solutions of the HCDG where the Evader, which is slower than the pursuing car, has simple motion. The similarities can be attributed to the fact that both the DCOCPs and the HCDG dynamics have two states and the Pursuer in the HCDG is modeled as a Dubins car. Because of these similarities, the solutions to the DCOCPs yield insights into the solutions of the attendant HCDGs where the Pursuer is endowed with a circular, or a line segment, capture set. This paper develops the solution to the optimal control problem of a Dubins car with a line segment capture set, presents the solution when the car is endowed with a circular capture set, and then draws comparisons to the respective HCDGs.},

  abstract = {We consider a variant of the target defense problem where a single defender is tasked to capture a sequence of incoming intruders. The intruders‚Äô objective is to breach the target boundary without being captured by the defender. As soon as the current intruder breaches the target or gets captured by the defender, the next intruder appears at a random location on a fixed circle surrounding the target. Therefore, the defender‚Äôs final location at the end of the current game becomes its initial location for the next game. Thus, the players pick strategies that are advantageous for the current as well as for the future games. Depending on the information available to the players, each game is divided into two phases: partial information and full information phase. Under some assumptions on the sensing and speed capabilities, we analyze each agent‚Äôs strategy in both phases. We derive equilibrium strategies for both the players to optimize the capture percentage using the notions of engagement surface and capture circle. We quantify the percentage of capture for both finite and infinite sequences of incoming intruders.},

@article{hsu2022model,
  abstract = {We develop a model of the multi-agent perimeter-defense game to calculate how an adaptive defense should be organized. This model is inspired by the human immune system and captures settings such as heterogeneous teams, limited resource allocations, partial observability of the attacking side, and decentralization. An optimal defense, that minimizes the harm under constraints of the energy spent to maintain a large and diverse repertoire, must maintain coverage of the perimeter from a diverse attacker population. The model characterizes how a defense might take advantage of its ability to respond strongly to attackers of the same type but weakly to attackers of diverse types to minimize the number of diverse defenders and while reducing harm. We first study the model from a steady-state perimeter-defense perspective and then extend it to mobile defenders and evolving attacker distributions. The optimal defender distribution is supported on a discrete set and similarly a Kalman filter obtaining local information is able to track a discrete, sometimes unknown, attacker distribution. Simulation experiments are performed to study the efficacy of the model under different constraints.},

However, most available methods lack rigorous performance guarantees and they are often tailored to specific optimal control setups. In this paper, we present GuSTO (Guaranteed Sequential Trajectory Optimization), an algorithmic framework to solve trajectory optimization problems for control-affine systems with drift. GuSTO generalizes earlier SCP-based methods for trajectory optimization (by addressing, for example, goal-set constraints and problems with either fixed or free final time) and enjoys theoretical convergence guarantees in terms of convergence to, at least, a stationary point. The theoretical analysis is further leveraged to devise an accelerated implementation of GuSTO, which originally infuses ideas from indirect optimal control into an SCP context. Numerical experiments on a variety of trajectory optimization setups show that GuSTO generally outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches in terms of success rates, solution quality, and computation times.},

The target is cooperative, and its position, heading and speed are precisely known. The pursuing UAV has nonholonomic motion constraints, and therefore the path traveled must satisfy the minimum turn radius constraints. We consider the class of Dubins paths as candidate solutions, and analyze the characteristics of the six modes of Dubins paths where the final position is restricted to lie on the target circle with heading in the tangential direction of the circle. For each Dubins mode, we derive the feasibility limits, discontinuities and local extrema. Using this analysis the intercepting paths are found by a systematic bisection search in the feasible regions of each of the Dubins modes. We prove that the algorithm finds the optimal (shortest length) intercepting path if it is a Dubins path. If the shortest intercepting path is not a Dubins path for any given instance, the algorithm finds a tight lower bound and an upper bound to the optimal solution.},

@article{vonmoll2022pure,
  abstract = {The study of pursuit curves is valuable in the context of air-to-air combat as pure pursuit guidance (heading directly at the target) is oftentimes implemented. The problems considered in this paper concern a Pursuer, implementing pure pursuit (i.e., line of sight guidance), chasing an Evader who holds course. Previous results are applicable to the case in which capture is defined as the two agents being coincident, i.e., point capture. The focus here is on obtaining results for the more realistic case  where the pursuer is endowed with an effector whose range is finite. The scenario in which the Evader begins inside the Pursuer's effector range is also considered (i.e., escape from persistent surveillance, among other potential applications). Questions herein addressed include: does the engagement end in head-on collision or tail chase, will the Evader be captured or escape, what is the minimum distance the Pursuer will attain, for two Pursuers, is simultaneous capture/escape optimal and, if so, what is the optimal heading for the Evader (max time to capture, or min time to escape), and the feasibility for a fast Evader to escape from many Pursuers. Where possible, closed-form, analytic results are obtained, otherwise attention is given to computability with an eye towards real-time, on-board implementation.},

@thesis{vonmoll2022skirmish-level,
  abstract = {Supremacy in armed conflict comes not merely from superiority in capability or numbers but from how assets are used, down to the maneuvers of individual vehicles and munitions. This document outlines a research plan focused on skirmish-level tactics to militarily relevant scenarios. Skirmish-level refers to both the size of the adversarial engagement -- generally one vs. one, two vs. one, and/or one vs. two -- as well as the fact that the goal or objective of each team is well-established. The problem areas include pursuit-evasion and target guarding, either of which may be considered as sub-problems within military missions such as air-to-air combat, suppression/defense of ground-based assets, etc. In most cases, the tactics considered are comprised of the control policy of the agents (i.e., their spatial maneuvers), but may also include role assignment (e.g, whether to act as a decoy or striker) as well as discrete decisions (e.g., whether to engage or retreat). Skirmish-level tactics are important because they can provide insight into how to approach larger scale conflicts (many vs. many, many objectives, many decisions). Machine learning approaches such as reinforcement learning and neural networks have been demonstrated to be capable of developing controllers for large teams of agents. However, the performance of these controllers compared to the optimal (or equilibrium) policies is generally unknown. Differential Game Theory provides the means to obtain a rigorous solution to relevant scenarios in the form of saddle-point equilibrium control policies and the min/max (or max/min) cost / reward in the case of zero-sum games. When the equilibrium control policies can be obtained analytically, they are suitable for onboard / real-time implementation. Some challenges associated with the classical Differential Game Theory approach are explored herein. These challenges arise mainly due to the presence of singularities, which may appear in even the simplest differential games. The utility of skirmish-level solutions is demonstrated in (i) the multiple pursuer, single evader differential games, (ii) multi-agent turret defense scenarios, and (iii) engage or retreat scenarios. In its culmination, this work contributes differential game and optimal control solutions to novel scenarios, numerical techniques for computing singular surfaces, approximations for computationally-intensive solutions, and techniques for addressing scenarios with multiple stages or outcomes.},

@article{vonmoll2022lock-evade,
  abstract = {In this paper we model and analyze a scenario in the two-dimensional plane involving a mobile Attacker and stationary Defender. There are two possibilities for termination: the Attacker can collide with the Defender (engagement) or maneuver to a safe zone away from the Defender (retreat). The Defender is equipped with a directional turret, which it can rotate with a bounded rate. If the turret is aligned with the Attacker‚Äôs position, the Defender has a lock on the Attacker and may choose to fire on the Attacker. Thus, whether engaging or retreating, the Attacker has incentive to evade the turret‚Äôs line of sight and thereby avoid being locked-on. In the case of retreat, if lock-on occurs the Defender cooperates with the Attacker by withholding fire to allow the Attacker to retreat. However, if the Attacker chooses to engage and lock-on occurs, the Defender will open fire on the Attacker. We model the scenario as a set of differential games with different cost functionals depending on the type of termination. The agents are assumed to have full state information. In the case that the Defender can lock onto the Attacker the pre- and post-lock portions of the game are solved individually and combined together. Otherwise, the Attacker can terminate the game prior to lock-on and the game is comprised of a single stage. The equilibrium strategies are derived in each case, and a partitioning of the state space wherein a particular goal selection is optimal is constructed.},

In this paper, we provide three different Koopman representations for hybrid systems. The first is specific to switched systems, and the second and third preserve the original hybrid dynamics while eliminating the discrete state variables; the second approach is straightforward, and we provide conditions under which the transformation associated with the third holds. Eliminating discrete state variables provides computational benefits when using data-driven methods to learn the Koopman operator and its observables. Following this, we use deep learning to implement each representation on two test cases, discuss the challenges associated with those implementations, and propose areas of future work.},

It is well known that the interior of the Apollonius Circle (AC) is the evader's dominance region, however, it was unclear whether the evader could reach outside the initial AC without being captured. We construct a pursuit strategy that guarantees the capture of an evader within an arbitrarily close neighborhood of the initial AC. The pursuer strategy is derived by reformulating the game into a nonlinear control problem, and the guarantee holds against any admissible evader strategy. Our result implies that the evader can freely select the capture location, but only inside the initial AC. Therefore, a class of problems, including those where the payoff is determined solely based on the location of capture, are now trivial.},

@article{zinage2021koopman,
  abstract = {In this paper, we systematically derive a finite set of Koopman based observables to construct a lifted linear state space model that describes the rigid body dynamics based on the dual quaternion representation. In general, the Koopman operator is a linear infinite dimensional operator, which means that the derived linear state space model of the rigid body dynamics will be infinite-dimensional, which is not suitable for modeling and control design purposes. Recently, finite approximations of the operator computed by means of methods like the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) have shown promising results for different classes of problems. However, without using an appropriate set of observables in the EDMD approach, there can be no guarantees that the computed approximation of the nonlinear dynamics is sufficiently accurate. The major challenge in using the Koopman operator for constructing a linear state space model is the choice of observables. State-of-the-art methods in the field compute the approximations of the observables by using neural networks, standard radial basis functions (RBFs), polynomials or heuristic approximations of these functions. However, these observables might not providea sufficiently accurate approximation or representation of the dynamics. In contrast, we first show the pointwise convergence of the derived observable functions to zero, thereby allowing us to choose a finite set of these observables. Next, we use the derived observables in EDMD to compute the lifted linear state and input matrices for the rigid body dynamics. Finally, we show that an LQR type (linear) controller, which is designed based on the truncated linear state space model, can steer the rigid body to a desired state while its performance is commensurate with that of a nonlinear controller. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated through numerical simulations.},

  abstract = {An engagement scenario involving the defense of a non-maneuverable agent, called the Target, is considered. A pursuing agent, engages the non-maneuverable Target while a defending agent, which aims at intercepting the Pursuer in order to protect the Target, is considered in 3-Dimensions. A zero-sum differential game is formulated where the objective of the Defender is to capture the Pursuer and maximize the terminal Pursuer-Target range at final time; while the Pursuer aims at minimizing the terminal Pursuer-Target range at final time. The terminal time is not fixed and is determined by the interception of the Pursuer by the Defender. The saddle point state-feedback strategies for the Pursuer and the Defender are obtained using a gradient-based minimization routine. A comparison of the saddle point strategy against a heuristic approach, Pure Pursuit, is conducted. The comparison demonstrates that poorer performance is achieved by players who deviate from the optimal saddle point strategy; and, as a result, the saddle point strategies outperform the heuristic method.},

@inproceedings{bajaj2022competitive,
  abstract = {This work addresses a perimeter defense problem in a planar conical environment in which a single vehicle, having a finite capture radius, aims to defend a concentric perimeter from mobile intruders. The intruders are arbitrarily released at the circumference of the environment and move radially toward the perimeter with fixed speed. We present a competitive analysis approach to this problem by measuring the performance of multiple online algorithms for the vehicle against arbitrary inputs relative to an optimal offline algorithm that has access to all future inputs. In particular, we first establish a necessary condition on the parameter space to guarantee finite competitiveness of any algorithm and then characterize parameter regime in which one must expect a competitive ratio of at least 2. We then design and analyze three online algorithms and characterize parameter regimes for which they have finite competitive ratios. Specifically, our first two algorithms are provably 1, and 2-competitive, respectively, whereas our third algorithm exhibits a finite competitive ratio that depends on the problem parameters. Finally, we provide numerous parameter space plots providing insights into the relative performance of our algorithms.},

@article{fu2021optimal,
  abstract = {A target defense game with two defenders and a faster intruder is solved based on the classic differential game theory. In the game, the intruder seeks to enter a circular target area, while the defenders endeavor to capture it outside of the target. Under the faster intruder assumption, the game has two phases, where the optimal trajectories are straight and curved, respectively. In the second phase, a peculiar phenomenon exists where the intruder moves at the edge of one defender‚Äôs capture region, yet this defender cannot force capture. Because of this, the terminal states of the game are singular, therefore the standard method of integrating optimal trajectories from terminal states is not applicable. The way to circumvent this singularity is to solve the optimal trajectories of a two-player game between the intruder and the closer defender, and assemble them with the trajectory of the other defender. The key contribution of this paper is the solution of the intruder-closer-defender subgame against a circular target area. In the vector field of the optimal trajectories, two singular surfaces and a singular point are observed. Each singular surface indicates a discontinuity in the closer defender‚Äôs control, while the singular point represents a situation where the target is successfully protected by a single defender. The complete solution of the two-defender game is solved based on the result of the intruder-closer-defender subgame. The proposed solution is verified through a special case where the capture range is zero. This verification also presents a simpler approach of solving the zero capture range problem.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews a series of works done on the multi-agent perimeter defense scenario, in which a team of intruders try to score by reaching the target region while a team of defenders try to minimize the score by intercepting those intruders. We describe how the small-scale differential games are solved and are leveraged to design team strategies in the large-scale swarm versus swarm scenarios. Three different approaches to analyze the large-scale games (MM, MIS, and LGR) are introduced with comments on their relative strengths and weaknesses. As a unique contribution of this paper, we discuss how the existing results can be extended into more general problem formulations. Furthermore, we point out the limitations of the current work and suggest potential directions for future research.},

@inproceedings{strickland2021learning,
  abstract = {UAVs are becoming increasingly commonplace, and with their growing popularity, the question of how to counter a swarm of UAVs operated by bad actors becomes more critical. In this paper, we explore the possibility of using a team of fixed-wing UAVs to counter an adversarial swarm of fixed-wing UAVs. To learn to coordinate counter-swarm tactics, we propose Situation-Dependent Option-action Evaluation (SDOE), a distributed and scalable actor-critic RL architecture. Our approach enables each UAV to evaluate options over a set of scripted tactics as well as the option to maneuver freely, allowing for emergent team behavior. A key to the scalability of our approach is a novel, distributed neural network architecture that enables agents to share situational awareness and select tactics in a pairwise fashion, allowing agents to choose who to coordinate with, when, and how regardless of the size of the swarm. We test agents trained with our approach in simulated engagements of up to 16-vs.-16 UAVs, and find that, even as the size of the engagement increases, the agents trained using SDOE against a greedy, non-coordinating tactic win engagements against a team of greedy agents more reliably than another team of greedy agents.},

@article{breitner2005genesis,
  abstract = {Abstract. Rufus P. Isaacs joined the RAND Corporation4, Santa Monica, California in 1948 and started to develop the theory of dynamic games in the early 1950s. Until winter 1954/55, when Isaacs left the RAND Corporation, he investigated two player, zero-sum dynamic games of the classic pursuit-evasion type. Prior to 1965, Isaacs published his theory only in internal RAND papers and research memoranda. In his first RAND paper (Ref. 1), Isaacs sketched the basic ideas of zero-sum dynamic game theory. The ideas already included rudimentary precursors of the maximum principle, dynamic programming, and backward analysis. At the end of 1954 and the beginning of 1955, Isaacs summarized his research in four research memoranda (Refs. 3‚Äì6), which ten years later formed the basis of his famous book on Differential Games (Ref. 7). This paper surveys Isaacs‚Äô research with an emphasis on the early years of dynamic games. The readers are kindly invited to discuss the author‚Äôs point of view. Comments and statements sent to the author will be summarized and published later.},

Using the Iterative Best Response (IBR) scheme, we solve for each player's optimal strategy assuming the other players' trajectories are known and fixed. Leveraging recent advances in Sequential Convex Programming (SCP), we use SCP as a subroutine within the IBR algorithm to efficiently solve an approximation of each player's constrained trajectory optimization problem. We apply the approach to an asset-guarding game example involving multiple pursuers and a single evader (i.e., n-versus-1 engagements). Resulting evader trajectories are tested in simulation to verify successful evasion against pursuers using conventional intercept guidance laws.},

@article{malyuta2021convex,
  abstract = {Reliable and efficient trajectory generation methods are a fundamental need for autonomous dynamical systems of tomorrow. The goal of this article is to provide a comprehensive tutorial of three major convex optimization-based trajectory generation methods: lossless convexification (LCvx), and two sequential convex programming algorithms known as SCvx and GuSTO. In this article, trajectory generation is the computation of a dynamically feasible state and control signal that satisfies a set of constraints while optimizing key mission objectives. The trajectory generation problem is almost always nonconvex, which typically means that it is not readily amenable to efficient and reliable solution onboard an autonomous vehicle. The three algorithms that we discuss use problem reformulation and a systematic algorithmic strategy to nonetheless solve nonconvex trajectory generation tasks through the use of a convex optimizer. The theoretical guarantees and computational speed offered by convex optimization have made the algorithms popular in both research and industry circles. To date, the list of applications includes rocket landing, spacecraft hypersonic reentry, spacecraft rendezvous and docking, aerial motion planning for fixed-wing and quadrotor vehicles, robot motion planning, and more. Among these applications are high-profile rocket flights conducted by organizations like NASA, Masten Space Systems, SpaceX, and Blue Origin. This article aims to give the reader the tools and understanding necessary to work with each algorithm, and to know what each method can and cannot do. A publicly available source code repository supports the provided numerical examples. By the end of the article, the reader should be ready to use the methods, to extend them, and to contribute to their many exciting modern applications.},

  abstract = {A reach-avoid differential game with two evaders and one pursuer is considered in the plane which is divided into a play region and a goal region by a straight line. Two evaders, starting from the play region, aim at reaching the goal region protected by the faster pursuer who tries to capture the evaders. This game is analysed from kind and degree in analytical forms. The information structure involves that the evaders know which one is being pursued by the pursuer while the pursuer has access to the evaders' current control inputs. We are concerned with the barrier and winning regions, by which the number of evaders reaching the goal region before being captured can be determined. Cooperative strategies for two evaders are derived based on the goal priority between team goal and individual goal. An Apollonius circle based pursuit strategy is explicitly proposed. The Œ¥-Apollonius circle is introduced to handle with the pursuit of the second-pursued evader. When two evaders are both possible to be captured, motivated by the cooperation between two prey animals against a predator, an aiding strategy is proposed such that one evader sacrifices itself to help the other's evasion. Numerical simulations are presented.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the Lifeline Differential Game with limited lifetime in a plane which is divided by the lifeline into a play region and a goal region. A single evader aims at entering the goal region from the play region by penetrating the lifeline without being captured, while a single pursuer strives to prevent the evader from that by capturing or delaying it with non-zero capture radius. We introduce the concept of the limited lifetime within which the evader has to achieve its goal. Determining the game winner and finding the strategies for two players are challenging due to non-unique terminal conditions and various initial configurations, which is beyond the scope of the classical Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi‚ÄìIsaacs (HJI) approach. An evasion-region based geometric method is proposed to solve this game qualitatively and quantitatively. A new class of Apollonius circles is first introduced and thus a pursuit strategy is proposed for the pursuer to capture the evader at a guaranteed distance of the lifeline. Based on the pursuit strategy, the space of initial states is separated by the so-called barrier into two winning regions which lead to different outcomes of the game. In each winning region, a critical payoff function is designed and the optimal strategy for each player is investigated. The extension to multiplayer cases is also discussed. The presented results are analytical and thus allow for real-time updates.},

Using simple motion, four potential approaches are considered. First, the min-time strategy which ignores the engagement zone is posed and solved. Second, the min-time strategy which avoids the engagement zone entirely is considered. Third, the min-time strategy which allows for some time in the engagement zone; but, still strives to stay away from the center of the engagement zone is posed. Lastly, a fixed final-time strategy is considered, wherein the target tries to avoid the engagement zone; but, is required to arrive at the desired location at a specific time. Using a nonlinear program solver, the optimal strategies are numerically solved. From the results of the numeric solutions, the optimal strategies are discussed and comparisons are drawn.},

@article{lee2021optimal,
  abstract = {We revisit the two-player planar target-defense game posed in [1], a special class of pursuit-evasion games in which the pursuer (or defender) strives to defend a stationary target area from the evader (or intruder) who desires to reach it, if possible, or approach it as close as possible. In this paper, the target area is assumed to be a compact and convex set. Unlike classical two-player pursuit-evasion games, this game involves two subgames: a capture game and an escape game. In the capture game, where capture is assured, the evader attempts to minimize the distance between her final position and the target area whereas the pursuer tries to maximize the same distance. In the escape game, where capture is not guaranteed, the evader attempts to maximize the distance between herself and the pursuer at the moment that she reaches the target for the first time. Our solution approach is based on Isaacs classical method in differential games. We first identify the barrier surface that demarcates the state space of the game into two subspaces, each of which corresponds to the two aforementioned subgames, by means of geometric arguments. Thereafter, we derive the optimal strategies for the players in each subspace. We show that, as long as the target area is compact and convex, the value of the game in each subspace is always continuously differentiable, and the proposed optimal strategies correspond to the unique saddle-point state-feedback strategies for the players. We illustrate our proposed solutions by means of numerical simulations.},

@article{vonmoll2022turret-runner-penetrator,
  abstract = {A scenario is considered in which two cooperative Attackers aim to infiltrate a circular target guarded by a Turret.  The engagement plays out in the two dimensional plane; the holonomic Attackers have the same speed and move with simple motion and the Turret is stationary, located at the target circle's center, and has a bounded turn rate.  When the Turret's look angle is aligned with an Attacker, that Attacker is neutralized.  In this paper, we focus on a region of the state space wherein only one of the Attackers is able to reach the target circle -- and even then, only with the help of its partner Attacker.  The Runner distracts the Turret and ends up being neutralized in order that the Penetrator can be guaranteed to hit the target circle.  We formulate the Turret-Runner-Penetrator scenario as a differential game over the Value of the subsequent game of min/max terminal angle which takes place between the Turret and Penetrator once the Runner has been neutralized.  The solution to the Game of Degree, including equilibrium Turret, Runner, and Penetrator strategies, as well as the Value function are given.  The case in which the Penetrator can reach the target before the Turret can neutralize the Runner is formulated and solved.  Finally, the assumption of a priori defined roles/goals is relaxed and the minimum of the solutions to the two fixed-role games is shown to be a Global Stackelberg Equilibrium.},

@phdthesis{dorothy2016neuroinspired,
  abstract = {This dissertation is centered on a theoretical, simulation, and experimental study of control strategies which are inspired by biological systems. Biological systems, along with sufficiently complicated engineered systems, often have many interacting degrees of freedom and need to excite large-displacement oscillations in order to locomote. Combining these factors can make high-level control design difficult. This thesis revolves around three different levels of abstraction, providing tools for analysis and design. First, we consider central pattern generators (CPGs) to control flapping-flight dynamics. The key idea here is dimensional reduction - we want to convert complicated interactions of many degrees of freedom into a handful of parameters which have intuitive connections to the overall system behavior, leaving the control designer unconcerned with the details of particular motions. A rigorous mathematical and control theoretic framework to design complex three-dimensional wing motions is presented based on phase synchronization of nonlinear oscillators. In particular, we show that flapping-flying dynamics without a tail or traditional aerodynamic control surfaces can be effectively controlled by a reduced set of central pattern generator parameters that generate phase-synchronized or symmetry-breaking oscillatory motions of two main wings. Furthermore, by using a Hopf bifurcation, we show that tailless aircraft (inspired by bats) alternating between flapping and gliding can be effectively stabilized by smooth wing motions driven by the central pattern generator network. Results of numerical simulation with a full six-degree-of-freedom flight dynamic model validate the effectiveness of the proposed neurobiologically inspired control approach. Further, we present experimental micro aerial vehicle (MAV) research with low-frequency flapping and articulated wing gliding. The importance of phase difference control via an abstract mathematical model of central pattern generators is confirmed with a robotic bat on a 3-DOF pendulum platform. An aerodynamic model for the robotic bat based on the complex wing kinematics is presented. Closed loop experiments show that control dimension reduction is achievable - unstable longitudinal modes are stabilized and controlled using only two control parameters. A transition of flight modes, from flapping to gliding and vice-versa, is demonstrated within the CPG control scheme. The second major thrust is inspired by this idea that mode switching is useful. Many bats and birds adopt a mixed strategy of flapping and gliding to provide agility when necessary and to increase overall efficiency. This work explores dwell time constraints on switched systems with multiple, possibly disparate invariant limit sets. We show that, under suitable conditions, trajectories globally converge to a superset of the limit sets and then remain in a second, larger superset. We show the effectiveness of the dwell-time conditions by using examples of nonlinear switching limit cycles from our work on flapping flight. This level of abstraction has been found to be useful in many ways, but it also produces its own challenges. For example, we discuss death of oscillation which can occur for many limit-cycle controllers and the difficulty in incorporating fast, high-displacement reflex feedback. This leads us to our third major thrust - considering biologically realistic neuron circuits instead of a limit cycle abstraction. Biological neuron circuits are incredibly diverse in practice, giving us a convincing rationale that they can aid us in our quest for flexibility. Nevertheless, that flexibility provides its own challenges. It is not currently known how most biological neuron circuits work, and little work exists that connects the principles of a neuron circuit to the principles of control theory. We begin the process of trying to bridge this gap by considering the simplest of classical controllers, PD control. We propose a simple two-neuron, two-synapse circuit based on the concept that synapses provide attenuation and a delay. We present a simulation-based method of analysis, including a smoothing algorithm, a steady-state response curve, and a system identification procedure for capturing differentiation. There will never be One True Control Method that will solve all problems. Nature's solution to a diversity of systems and situations is equally diverse. This will inspire many strategies and require a multitude of analysis tools. This thesis is my contribution of a few.},

The pursuer‚Äôs objective is to capture the non-maneuvering evader in minimum time while a defender aims at keeping the pursuer inside his circular engagement zone for as long as possible; the pursuer is considered to be faster than both the evader and the defender.  Using the calculus of variations the optimal control problem for the defender which maximizes the amount of time that the pursuer is inside his area of effect is posed and solved. In the event that the evader is captured by the pursuer before the pursuer escapes the area of effect of the defender, some suboptimal strategies of the defender provide equivalent contact time. The derivation of the headings which the defender can take to maximally contact the pursuer is presented, along with examples which highlight the importance of the initial conditions of the engagement scenario.},

  abstract = {A two-player, Engage or Retreat (EoR) differential game is presented in which an attacker must choose whether to capture one of N static targets or retreat across a defined retreat boundary. Throughout the engagement, a defending player is capable of activating defensive assets located at each of the target locations. These defensive assets inflict a cost on the attacker as a function of distance and allow the defender to present a deterrent in an effort to persuade the attacker to elect retreat. The solution of the game is constructed by examining two related subproblems: the Game of Engagement (GoE) and the Optimal Constrained Retreat (OCR). Each subproblem examines a different combination of attacker termination strategies, capture vs retreat, and defender strategies, resist vs cooperate. When solving for the optimal constrained retreat strategy, a value function constraint is imposed on the retreat trajectory in order to ensure that the attacker does not maneuver into an advantageous position.

This is a variant of the target defense problem proposed by Isaacs as a pursuit-evasion game. Unlike the original target guarding problem and its various extensions, we consider the effect of partial information by imposing sensing limitation to the robots. We analyze the game by decomposing it into three game phases: deployment, asymmetric information, and engagement phase. Focusing on a particular parameter regime, we propose a simple defender strategy together with the lower bound on the probability that it wins the game. The defender strategy in each phase is constructed so that the subsequent phase starts in a desired initial configuration. The proposed problem is rich in terms of the parameter regimes that it contains, and thus is expected to be a useful platform in exploring effective control policies.},

We develop a planning-as-inference framework in which agents perform nested simulation to reason about the behavior of other agents in an online manner. As a concrete application of this framework, we use probabilistic programs to model a high-uncertainty variant of pursuit-evasion games in which an agent must make inferences about the other agents' plans to craft counter-plans. Our probabilistic programs incorporate a variety of complex primitives such as field-of-view calculations and path planners, which enable us to model quasi-realistic scenarios in a computationally tractable manner. We perform extensive experimental evaluations which establish a variety of rational behaviors and quantify how allocating computation across levels of nesting affects the variance of our estimators.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of planning for visibility-based pursuit evasion, in con- texts where the pursuer robot may experience some positioning errors as it moves in search of the evader. Specifically, we consider the case in which a pursuer with an omnidirectional sensor searches a known environment to locate an evader thatmaymove arbitrarily quickly. Known algorithms for this problem are based on decompositions of the environment into regions, followed by a search for a sequence of those regions through which the pursuer should pass. In this paper, we note that these regions can be arbitrarily small, and thus that the movement accuracy required of the pursuer may be arbitrarily high. To resolve this limitation, we introduce the notion of an epsilon-robust solution strategy, in which epsilon is an upper bound on the positioning error that the pursuer may experience. We establish sufficient conditions under which a solution strategy is epsilon-robust, and introduce an algorithm that determines, for a given environment, the largest value of epsilon for which a solution strategy satisfying those sufficient conditions exists. We describe an implementation and show simulated results demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.},

@mastersthesis{johnson2009numerical,
  abstract = {Differential game theory provides a potential means for the parametric analysis of combat engagement scenarios. To determine its viability for this type of analysis, three frameworks for solving differential game problems are evaluated. Each method solves zero-sum, pursuit-evasion games in which two players have opposing goals. A solution to the saddle-point equilibrium problem is sought in which one player minimizes the value of the game while the other player maximizes it. The boundary value method is an indirect method that makes use of the analytical necessary conditions of optimality and is solved using a conventional optimal control framework. This method provides a high accuracy solution but has a limited convergence space that requires a good initial guess for both the state and less intuitive costate. The decomposition method in which optimal trajectories for each player are iteratively calculated is a direct method that bypasses the need for costate information. Because a linearized cost gradient is used to update the evader's strategy the initial conditions can heavily influence the convergence of the problem. The new method of neural networks involves the use of neural networks to govern the control policy for each player. An optimization tool adjusts the weights and biases of the network to form the control policy that results in the best final value of the game. An automatic differentiation engine provides gradient information for the sensitivity of each weight to the final cost. The final weights define the control policy's response to a range of initial conditions dependent upon the breadth of the state-space used to train each neural network. The neural nets are initialized with a normal distribution of weights so that no information regarding the state, costate, or switching structure of the controller is required. In its current form this method often converges to a sub-optimal solution. Also, creative techniques are required when dealing with boundary conditions and free end-time problems.},

@inproceedings{vonmoll2021turret,
  abstract = {In this paper we model and analyze a scenario in the two dimensional plane involving a mobile Attacker and stationary Defender. There are two possibilities for termination: the Attacker can collide with the Defender (engagement) or maneuver to a safe zone away from the Defender (retreat). The Defender is equipped with a directional turret which it can rotate with a bounded rate. If the turret is aligned with the Attacker's position, the Defender has a lock on the Attacker and may choose to fire on the Attacker. Thus, whether engaging or retreating, the Attacker has incentive to evade the turret's line of sight and thereby avoid being locked-on. In the case of retreat, if lock-on occurs the Defender cooperates with the Attacker by withholding fire to allow the Attacker to retreat. However, if the Attacker chooses to engage and lock-on occurs, the Defender will open fire on the Attacker. We model the scenario as a set of differential games with different cost functionals depending on the type of termination. The agents are assumed to have full state information. In the case that the Defender can align with the Attacker the pre- and post-lock portions of the game are solved individually and stitched together. The equilibrium strategies are derived in each case, and a partitioning of the state space wherein a particular termination condition is optimal is constructed.},

  abstract = {A scenario is considered in which two cooperative Attackers aim to infiltrate a circular target guarded by a Turret. The engagement plays out in the two dimensional plane; the holonomic Attackers have the same speed and move with simple motion and the Turret is stationary, located at the target circle's center, and has a bounded turn rate. When the Turret's look angle is aligned with an Attacker, that Attacker is terminated. In this paper, we focus on a region of the state space wherein only one of the Attackers is able to reach the target circle -- and even then, only with the help of its partner Attacker. The Runner distracts the Turret and ends up being terminated in order that the Penetrator can be guaranteed to hit the target circle. We formulate the Turret-Runner-Penetrator scenario as a differential game over the Value of the subsequent game of $\min\max$ terminal angle which takes place between the Turret and Penetrator once the Runner has been terminated. The solution to the Game of Degree, including equilibrium Turret, Runner, and Penetrator strategies, as well as the Value function are given. In addition, the Game of Kind solution, which is the manifold of states in which the Penetrator will be terminated exactly on the target circle, is constructed numerically.},

The pursuers try to capture the evader as far as possible from the goal line. Leveraging differential game theory, state feedback strategies are both synthesized and verified in this paper. In addition, the Barrier surface that partitions the state space into two winning sets, one for the pursuer team and one for the evader, is obtained in analytical form.

  abstract = {In this paper, the problem of guarding a circular target wherein the Defender(s) is constrained to move along its perimeter is posed and solved using a differential game theoretic approach. Both the one-Defender and two-Defender scenarios are analyzed and solved. The mobile Attacker seeks to reach the perimeter of the circular target, whereas the Defender(s) seeks to align itself with the Attacker, thereby ending the game. In the former case, the Attacker wins, and the Attacker and Defender play a zero sum differential game where the payoff/cost is the terminal angular separation. In the latter case, the Defender(s) wins, and the Attacker and Defender play a zero sum differential game where the cost/payoff is the Attacker‚Äôs terminal distance to the target. This formulation is representative of a scenario in which the Attacker inflicts damage on the target as a function of its terminal distance. The state-feedback equilibrium strategies and Value functions for the Attacker-win and Defender(s)-win scenarios are derived for both the one- and two-Defender cases, thus providing a solution to the Game of Degree. Analytic expressions for the separating surfaces between the various terminal scenarios are derived, thus providing a solution to the Game of Kind.},

  abstract = {In this work, we consider a two-agent scenario consisting of an observer and non-maneuvering target. In the scenario, the observer is considered to be maneuverable and slower than the target. The observer is endowed with a nonzero radius of observation within which he strives at keeping the target for as long as possible. Using the calculus of variations, we pose and solve the optimal control problem, solving for the heading and flight path angle of the observer to maximize the amount of time the target vehicle is contained within his observation radius. Using the optimal observer heading and flight path angle, the exposure time is computed, based upon the initial azimuth and elevation by which the target is captured by the observer. The special cases, where the engagement may be represented in a plane, rather than 3-D, are also provided. Presented, along with examples, are the zero-time of exposure conditions, maximum exposure time conditions, and a proof that observation is persistent under the optimal observer strategy.},

@article{manyam2020curvature,
  abstract = {We present a path planning problem for a pursuing agent to intercept a target traveling on a circle. The target is cooperative, and its position, heading and speed are precisely known by the pursuing agent. The pursuing agent has nonholonomic motion constraints, and therefore the path traveled by the pursuing agent must satisfy the minimum turn radius constraints. We consider the class of Dubins paths as candidate solutions, and analyze the characteristics of the six modes of Dubins paths where the final position is restricted to lie on the target circle with heading in the tangential direction of the circle. For each Dubins mode, we derive the feasibility limits, discontinuities and local extrema. Using this analysis the intercepting paths are found by a systematic bisection search in the feasible regions of each of the Dubins modes. We prove that the algorithm outputs the optimal solution, if the optimal intercepting path is a Dubins path; otherwise, it outputs the best found intercepting path and a tight lower bound to the optimal solution.},

@inproceedings{vonmoll2020guarding,
  abstract = {In this paper, the problem of guarding a circular target wherein the Defender(s) is constrained to move along its perimeter is posed and solved using a differential game theoretic approach. Both the one-Defender and two-Defender scenarios are analyzed and solved. The mobile Attacker seeks to reach the perimeter of the circular target, whereas the Defender(s) seeks to align itself with the Attacker, thereby ending the game. In the former case, the Attacker wins, and the Attacker and Defender play a zero sum differential game where the payoff/cost is the terminal angular separation. In the latter case, the Defender(s) wins, and the Attacker and Defender play a zero sum differential game where the cost/payoff is the Attacker‚Äôs terminal distance to the target. This formulation is representative of a scenario in which the Attacker inflicts damage on the target as a function of its terminal distance. The state-feedback equilibrium strategies and Value functions for the Attacker-win and Defender(s)-win scenarios are derived for both the one- and two-Defender cases, thus providing a solution to the Game of Degree. Analytic expressions for the separating surfaces between the various terminal scenarios are derived, thus providing a solution to the Game of Kind.},

@inproceedings{vonmoll2020evolutionary,
  abstract = {In this paper a scenario is considered in which a group of predators cooperate to maximize the number of prey captures over a finite time horizon on a two-dimensional plane. The emphasis is on developing predator strategies, and thus the behavior of the prey agents is fixed to a Boids-like flocking model which incorporates avoidance of nearby predators. At each time instant, the predators have control authority over their heading angle; however, we restrict the headings to be governed by one of five different pre-specified behaviors. No communication occurs between the predator agents - each agent determines its own control without knowledge of what the other predators will implement; thus, the predator strategies are fully decentralized. The full state space of the system is collapsed to a set of features which is independent of the number of prey. An evolutionary algorithm is used to evolve an anchor point controller wherein the anchor point lies in the feature space and has a particular predator behavior associated, thus providing a candidate solution to the question of "what to do when". The two predator case is the focus in this work, although the ideas could be applied to larger groups of predators. The strategies resulting from the evolutionary algorithm favor aiming at the nearest prey mostly, and also avoiding having the predators getting too close and then pursuing the same prey. Thus useless behaviors are generally not present among the elite at the end of the evolutionary process.},

The model is based on feedback control of constant speed steered particles on the plane. Dynamics over a reduced set of shape variables are defined. Parallel-motion shape equilibria are studied, with stability analysis and analytic solutions provided for special cases in the parameter space.

This chapter discusses the four interrelated aspects of that adaptation: (1) group hunting practices, (2) intrapack aggressive behavior, (3) reproduction, and (4) wolf individuality. Wolves are social hunters that cooperatively capture prey animals larger than themselves. Seasonal variation has been observed in the incidence of aggression within the wolf pack. Aggressive behavior is particularly significant in two contexts: (1) the regulation of pack size and (2) the determination of rank‚Äìorder relationships in the pack with special reference toward breeding. Mating systems of wolves includes breeding by the monogamous dominant pair, the beta male mating with the dominant female while the alpha male maintains the territory, and the dominant female copulating with several of the top-ranked males. The wolf, large wild dog of the boreal forests, remains an elusive subject for study.},

The intruder team tries to score by sending as many intruders as possible to the target area, while the defender team tries to minimize this score by intercepting them. Finding the optimal strategies of the game is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the joint state space, and the existing works have proposed approximation methods to reduce the design of the defense strategy into assignment problems. However they suffer from either suboptimal defender performance or computational complexity. Based on a novel decomposition method, this paper proposes a scalable (polynomial-time) assignment algorithm that accommodates cooperative behaviors and outperforms the existing defense strategies. For a certain class of initial configurations, we derive the exact score by showing that the lower bound provided by the intruder team matches the upper bound provided by the defender team, which also proves the optimality of the team strategies.},

In this report, we model a pursuit-evasion game as a finite extensive form game, and show that the differential game is a generalization of this game. We prove that a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium always exists in an extensive game formulation, which is not always possible in differential games. Next we show that a finite-time termination issue can be resolved by modifying extensive form as a repeated game. Furthermore, we prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium in this repeated game. Finally, we discuss the relationship between repeated game and a popular approach known as probabilistic pursuit-evasion game. 1},

We consider the scenario in which multiple guardians with limited perceptual range are deployed to protect an area from an aerial intruder. The intruder becomes a target once it enters the perceptual range of a guardian and, when a guardian becomes a pursuer, it speeds up and chases the target. We focus on the strategy in the swarming phase, when the intruder has not yet been perceived by any of the guardians. In the parameter space consisting of the intruder's speed and guardians' ability (i.e., maximum acceleration and perceptual range) we identify necessary and sufficient conditions for target capture. We further compare circular and radial swarming motion and its effect on successful target capture. For the application to autonomous aerial vehicles, we propose a control algorithm that achieves swarming motion while also avoiding collisions. The theoretical results are demonstrated by experiments with a swarm of quadrotors.},

The Defender is modeled as a stationary target located at the origin, and it is capable of steering a direction of focus toward the Attacker. The game terminates when the Attacker intercepts the Defender. Over the course of the game, the Attacker incurs an integral cost. The cost functional consists of a constant time penalty and a Defender generated cost based on the relative agents positions. The goal of the Attacker is to terminate the game with minimal cost, while the Defender strives to maximize the Attacker's cost.

The common thread is the existence of a linear space with a topology or two (or more). Here the paths diverge in the choice of how that topology is defined and in whether to study the geometry of the linear space, or the linear operators on the space, or both. In this book I have tried to follow the common thread rather than any special topic. I have included some topics that a few years ago might have been thought of as specialized but which impress me as interesting and basic. Near the end of this work I gave into my natural temptation and included some operator theory that, though basic for operator theory, might be considered specialized by some functional analysts.},

We derive an analytical expression for the value function of the game and use a hold time to derive the rate of change for the loss of the time to capture along the dispersal line. Then we resolve the dilemma along the dispersal line using actions defined by the saddle point of the rate of change for the loss. Finally, we analyze the same game in a version with a non-zero hold time and show that in that case, the actions from the dispersal line have to be applied not only on the dispersal line, but in a narrow band around it. To illustrate that, we use an example to compute the band around the line.},

For certain parameter settings, the Attacker Dispersal Surface is present, while for others, the surface is absent. These regions in the parameter space are identified, and the numerical procedures to do so are detailed. Backwards shooting of the optimal state and adjoint dynamics features prominently in the procedures.

Although the analysis of this game plays an important role in many applications, the optimal solution to this game is computationally intractable when NA > 1 or ND > 1. In this technical note, we present two approaches for the NA = ND = 1 case to determine pairwise outcomes, and a graph theoretic maximum matching approach to merge these pairwise outcomes for an NA, ND > 1 solution that provides guarantees on the performance of the defending team. We will show that the four-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs approach allows for real-time updates to the maximum matching, and that the two-dimensional ‚Äúpath defense‚Äù approach is considerably more scalable with the number of players while maintaining defender performance guarantees.},

  abstract = {We consider pursuit-evasion differential games in the Euclidean plane where an evader is engaged by multiple pursuers and point capture is required. The players have simple motion √† la Isaacs and the pursuers are faster than the evader. We confine our attention to the case where the pursuers have the same speed, so the game‚Äôs parameter is the evader/pursuers speed ratio 0 < ¬µ < 1. State feedback capture strategies and an evader strategy which yields a lower bound on his time-to-capture are devised using a geometric method. It is shown that in group/swarm pursuit, when the players are in general position, capture is effected by one, two, or by three critical pursuers, and this irrespective of the size N (> 3) of the pursuit pack.  Group pursuit devolves into pure pursuit by one of the pursuers or into a pincer movement pursuit by two or three pursuers who isochronously capture the evader, a m√®nage √† trois. The critical pursuers are identified. However, these geometric method-based pursuit and evasion strategies are optimal only in a part of the state space where a strategic saddle point is obtained and the Value of the differential game is established, and as such, are suboptimal. To fully explore the differential game‚Äôs high dimensional state space and get a better understanding of group pursuit, numerical experimentation is undertaken. The state space region where the geometric method-based suboptimal solution of the group pursuit differential game is the optimal solution becomes larger the smaller the speed ratio parameter is.},

The data collection task is undertaken by a UAV which autonomously executes the mission. In addition to geographically distributed stations, the scenario also includes a central depot, where data collected from the different nodes must be delivered. In this context, the performance criteria, in addition to a desired minimal cycle time, also entails minimizing the delay in delivering the data collected from each node to the depot. Each node has a priority/ weight associated with it that characterizes the relative importance between timely delivery of data from the nodes. We pose the problem as an average/ cycle reward maximization problem; where the UAV gains a reward that is a decreasing function of weighted delay in data delivery from the nodes. Since we aim to maximize the average reward, the solution also favors shorter overall cycle time. In a cycle, each station is visited exactly once; however, we allow the UAV to visit the depot more than once in a cycle. Evidently, this allows for quicker delivery of data from a higher priority node. We apply results from average reward maximization stochastic dynamic programming to our deterministic case and solve the problem using Linear Programming. We also discuss the special case of no penalty on delivery delay, whence the problem collapses to the well known metric Traveling Salesman Problem.},

@inproceedings{vonmoll2014recent,
  abstract = {Thermal management has emerged as one of the primary challenges for modern military gas turbine engines. Fuel actuator pumping systems contribute to the challenge by constantly injecting waste heat into the fuel system. This is due to a fundamental mismatching between an actuation system with a low duty cycle and a pump which is always running. Since the pump is directly coupled to the gearbox, the detriment is twofold: horsepower is always being drawn to drive the pump, and heat is generated. Furthermore, the emergence of variable cycle engines pushes the actuation system in the direction of more effectors and more loads, which drives requirements for high pressure and high flows from the pumping system. Piston pumps have been seen as favorable for the actuation pump application due to their high single stage pressure rise capability. However reducing the number of pumping components alone has not solved the thermal management issue. Variable displacement pumps have been designed to operate over a range of conditions in order to deliver flow more appropriately as demanded by the control system. These pumps allow pressure and flow to be modulated independent of one another and of the pump‚Äôs rotational speed. Variable displacement pumps may be considered as a component of a partial-demand actuation pumping system. Even in a partial-demand actuation pumping system, a variable displacement pump will still be coupled to the gearbox and require some minimum flow for lubrication and cooling. On-demand actuation fuel systems deliver only the amount of flow that is being demanded at a given time so that waste heat is minimized. In other words, the duty cycle of the pumping system matches that of the actuation system. The development of an on-demand actuation fuel system will require a new architecture and new components.},

@article{boyell1976defending,

However, when the attacker's target, the counterweapon's launch platform, is moving, the problem generally becomes amenable only to trajectory simulation. Such may be the case in defense against torpedo attack against a ship and other situations involving the use of antimissile missiles. This paper derives the kinematic relations among the three bodies (missile, target, and counterweapon) in closed form under the asymptotic approximation of constant-bearing trajectories (collision courses). It is shown that the defending target, even if moving, can still determine the optimum course for its counterweapon when range and speed of the attacking vehicle are unknown. A simple relation is derived for the ratio between the attacker-target range (and time to impact) at counterweapon launch and the range at interception of the attacker by the counterweapon. Normalized curves are presented for some representative cases of defense by a counterweapon of known speed against a torpedo or missile attack on a moving target. The equations are shown to reduce to the familiar form for a stationary target.},

The Lie-group shooting method is very effective to search unknown initial condition through a weighting factor r ‚àà (0,1). Furthermore, the closedform solutions are derived to calculate the unknown initial condition in terms of r in a more refined range identified.  Numerical examples were examined to show that the new approach is highly efficient and accurate.

@thesis{seok2017resource,
  abstract = {Resource management is considered in this dissertation for systems with limited resources, possibly combined with other system constraints, in unpredictably dynamic environments. Resources may represent fuel, power, capabilities, energy, and so on. Resource management is important for many practical systems; usually, resources are limited, and their use must be optimized. Furthermore, systems are often constrained, and constraints must be satisfied for safe operation. Simplistic resource management can result in poor use of resources and failure of the system. Furthermore, many real-world situations involve dynamic environments. Many traditional problems are formulated based on the assumptions of given probabilities or perfect knowledge of future events. However, in many cases, the future is completely unknown, and information on or probabilities about future events are not available. In other words, we operate in unpredictably dynamic situations. Thus, a method is needed to handle dynamic situations without knowledge of the future, but few formal methods have been developed to address them. Thus, the goal is to design resource management methods for constrained systems, with limited resources, in unpredictably dynamic environments. To this end, resource management is organized hierarchically into two levels: 1) planning, and 2) control. In the planning level, the set of tasks to be performed is scheduled based on limited resources to maximize resource usage in unpredictably dynamic environments. In the control level, the system controller is designed to follow the schedule by considering all the system constraints for safe and efficient operation. Consequently, this dissertation is mainly divided into two parts: 1) planning level design, based on finite state machines, and 2) control level methods, based on model predictive control. We define a recomposable restricted finite state machine to handle limited resource situations and unpredictably dynamic environments for the planning level. To obtain a policy, dynamic programing is applied, and to obtain a solution, limited breadth-first search is applied to the recomposable restricted finite state machine. A multi-function phased array radar resource management problem and an unmanned aerial vehicle patrolling problem are treated using recomposable restricted finite state machines. Then, we use model predictive control for the control level, because it allows constraint handling and setpoint tracking for the schedule. An aircraft power system management problem is treated that aims to develop an integrated control system for an aircraft gas turbine engine and electrical power system using rate-based model predictive control. Our results indicate that at the planning level, limited breadth-first search for recomposable restricted finite state machines generates good scheduling solutions in limited resource situations and unpredictably dynamic environments. The importance of cooperation in the planning level is also verified. At the control level, a rate-based model predictive controller allows good schedule tracking and safe operations. The importance of considering the system constraints and interactions between the subsystems is indicated. For the best resource management in constrained dynamic situations, the planning level and the control level need to be considered together.},

  abstract = {A distributed engine control system (DECS) offering flexibility and scalability is envisioned for the next generation of propulsion controls. Perhaps the most touted benefit of a DECS is the potential to reduce the amount of harnessing which connects throughout the engine. Such a system is comprised of several network sections incorporating control nodes or data concentrators (DCs). These DCs contain control logic to perform control function computations and are connected to the full authority digital engine control (FADEC) via a high-speed data communication bus. A novel approach for analyzing and evaluating three topologies‚Äìring, star, and bus‚Äìin the context of a relevant military engine was described. In this study, the algorithm uses a particle swarm optimization process to evolve solutions to a multi-objective optimization problem. The results of this study indicate there is potential for large wire length savings in a distributed control architecture.},

@article{kalyanam2016optimal,
  abstract = {A novel mixed initiative optimal control system for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) operations which entails human-machine teaming has been developed. The scenario entails a camera-equipped unmanned air vehicle sequentially overflying geolocated objects of interest, which need to be classified as either a true or false target by a human operator. The vehicle is allowed a prespecified number of revisits, such that an object can be looked at, a second time, under better viewing conditions. The overarching goal is to correctly classify the objects and minimize the false alarm (FA) and missed detection (MD) rates. We design a stochastic controller that computes if and when a revisit is necessary and also the optimal revisit state, i.e., viewing altitude and aspect angle. The concept of operation is such that the critical task of detection/pattern recognition is relegated to the human operator, whereas optimal decision making is entrusted to the machine. The stochastic dynamic programming-based decision algorithm is, however, informed about the performance of the human operator via an empirical human perception model. The model is experimentally obtained in the form of state-dependent confusion matrices. The optimal closed-loop ISR system is shown to experimentally achieve a FA rate of 5% and MD rate of 12%, which are significantly lower than the open-loop operator-only performance metrics. The performance improvements that were observed are relevant to a particular operator, and thus, the study suggests that the same improvements could conceivably be achieved with other test subjects.},

In this paper, we deal with PE games with a fast evader which can match the speed of or outrun the pursuers. We apply the well-known Apollonius circles formed by the evader and each pursuer to analyze how the evader can find a better strategy to escape or prolong the capture time whenever a successful escape is not possible. Conversely, by observing the changing states of the evader, the pursuers cooperatively contain the evader by enclosing the evader inside a convex polygon, with its vertices being the pursuers‚Äô positions. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed strategies as well as the limitations of a successful pursuit of an intelligent evader.},

This simple solution is valid only if the second evader remains thereby the further of the two evaders.

@inproceedings{selvakumar2016evasion,
  abstract = {We consider the problem of characterizing an evasion strategy for an agent under pursuit by multiple independent agents that are distributed in a convex polygon. The proposed evasion strategy is centrally dependent on a generalized Voronoi partition of the polygon, whose proximity metric is the time of capture of the evader by the nearest pursuer. Specifically, the boundaries of the Voronoi cells determine a set of preferable paths for the evader that will safely take it to a prescribed target set. The motion of the pursuers is accounted for by sequential re-partitioning and re-planning. A novel method for the computation of the generalized Voronoi partition, which exploits the structure of the solution to a two-player differential game, is presented. It is shown that the proposed method is significantly faster (by at least one order of magnitude) than two known methods in the literature; this expedites computation of the proposed evasion strategy. Numerical simulations that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed evasion strategy are presented.},

For the multi-target problem where numerical computation of the exact solution is intractable, we use the hazard costs to construct an auxiliary Markov decision problem (MDP) which characterizes the intrinsic cost of occupying a state.

The reinforcement learning system uses a recently developed algorithm, the residual-gradient form of advantage updating. The game is a Markov decision process with continuous time, states, and actions, linear dynamics, and a quadratic cost function. The game consists of two players, a missile and a plane; the missile pursues the plane and the plane evades the missile. Although a missile and plane scenario was the chosen test-bed, the reinforcement learning approach presented here is equally applicable to biologically based systems, such as a predator pursuing prey. The reinforcement learning algorithm for optimal control is modified for differential games to find the minimax point rather than the maximum. Simulation results are compared to the analytical solution, demonstrating that the simulated reinforcement learning system converges to the optimal answer. The performance of both the residual-gradient and non-residual-gradient forms of advantage updating and Q-learning are compared, demonstrating that advantage updating converges faster than Q-learning in all simulations. Advantage updating is also demonstrated to converge regardless of the time step duration; Q-learning is unable to converge as the time step duration grows small.

The concept of smart components is built around actively controlling the engine and the aircraft to operate optimally. Usage of smart components intelligently increases efficiency and system safety throughout the flight envelope, all while meeting environmental challenges. This approach requires an integration and optimization, both at the local level and the system level, to reduce cost. Interactions between the various subsystems must be understood through the use of modeling and simulation. This is accomplished by starting with individual subsystem models and combining them into a complete system model. Hierarchical, decentralized control reduces cost and risk by enabling integration and modularity. This process involves defining, developing, and validating against requirements for key integrated propulsion, power, and thermal management system capabilities.},

@article{sun2017sequential,
  abstract = {We address the problem of pursuit between a collection of targets and a team of pursuers distributed in the plane subject to an environmental disturbance (e.g., wind, sea current). The objective of the pursuers is to intercept the moving targets which, however, are not affected by the presence of the flow field. We first solve the multiple-pursuers/single-target problem by assigning only one pursuer to chase the target at every instant of time, based on a Voronoi-like partition of the plane. During the pursuit, the pursuer assignment changes dynamically based on this partition. We then present an algorithm to efficiently update this Voronoi-like partition on-line. The results are then extended to the multiple-pursuers/multiple-targets case. Simulations are included to illustrate the theoretical results.},

@article{oyler2016pursuit-evasion,
  abstract = {This paper studies planar pursuit‚Äìevasion games in the presence of obstacles that inhibit the motions of the players. The goal is to construct the dominance regions, where a point in the plane is said to be dominated by one of the players if that player is able to reach the point before the opposing players, regardless of the opposing players‚Äô actions. The key achievements of the paper are to provide the dominance regions and to show that an analysis of dominance provides a complete solution to the game. This paper also presents a study of the effects of obstacles by comparing the dominance regions in the presence and absence of obstacles. The obstacles considered include line segments and polygons as well as obstacles that have asymmetric effects on the players. As part of the discussion, a novel, multiplayer pursuit‚Äìevasion game is also presented. It features three players on two teams, and it can be used to model rescue scenarios and biological behaviors. The solution of this game cannot be determined from the previous literature, but the methods provided in this paper are used to determine dominance and solve the game.},

@inproceedings{vonmoll2018pursuit-evasion,
  abstract = {In this paper, we extend the well-studied results of the two-pursuer, single-evader differential game to any number of pursuers. The main objective of this investigation is to exploit the benefits of cooperation amongst the pursuers in order to reduce the capture time of the evader. Computational complexity is a chief concern as this problem would need to be solved in an online fashion, e.g. in the case of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles. A new geometric approach to solving the game is introduced and analyzed, which changes the problem of optimizing over continuous domains to a discrete combinatoric optimization. While past efforts at solving multiple pursuer problems have suffered from the curse of dimensionality, the geometric algorithms put forth here are shown to be scalable. Categorization and removal of redundant pursuers is the primary means by which scalability is achieved. The solution of this problem serves as a stepping stone to more complex problems such as the M-pursuer N-evader differential game.},

@mastersthesis{anderson2018defender-assisted,
  abstract = {Motivated by the possibilities afforded by active target defense, a 3-agent pursuitevasion differential game involving an Attacker (Pursuer), a Target (Evader), and a Defender is considered. The Defender strives to assist the Target by intercepting the Attacker before the latter reaches the Target. A barrier surface in a reduced state space separates the winning regions of the Attacker and Target-Defender team. In this thesis, attention focuses primarily on the Attacker‚Äôs region of win where, under optimal Attacker play, the Defender cannot preclude the Attacker from capturing the Target. Both optimal and suboptimal strategies are investigated. This thesis uses several methods to breakdown and analyze the 3-player differential game. First, a heuristic analysis of the game is performed. This not only illustrates the game play, but provides insight into what optimal strategies might look like. The heuristic analysis selects points of interest for each of the players to chase, and then compares the results to find a global minimum or maximum of the points considered. The resulting strategies produce very effective chase points for each player to use against opposing player(s), however these points are not optimal when considering all possible strategies. Next, a barrier analysis is performed. Considering the region where the Attacker is guaranteed to win if he plays optimal, and the region where the Target and Defender team is guaranteed to in if they play optimally, the barrier surface is the dividing membrane that separates the two independent regions. The barrier analysis constructs strategies for each player using the barrier surface. The strategies are then tested to see how they perform as the state representing game play moves away from the barrier. The results of the analysis are used to find a Game of Kind solution that allows the Attacker to win, so long as the game begins in his region of win. Finally, the game is considered when using time as the performance functional. This not only satisfies the Game of Kind differential game, but does so in minimum time for the Attacker, and maximum time for the Target and Defender team. Although a complete solution when using time as the performance functional is not obtained, a partial solution is presented with an analysis on pursuit curves. The Attacker‚Äôs region of win is also split into two subregions that determine the strategies each player should employ. One region guarantees capture of the Target in minimum time by employing Pure Pursuit, and the other region opens a possibility for the Target to escape should the Attacker persist with Pure Pursuit. This research compliments on-going research being performed by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) in conjunction with the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT). The game has been coined by this team as the Active Target Defense Differential Game (ATDDG) and seeks understanding of optimal strategies for a specific air-to-air engagement scenario described in Chapter I. Originally, the research being performed by AFRL focused primarily on the region where the Target and Defender team will win if they play optimally, however, recently their focused has changed to the region where the Attacker is guaranteed to win if he plays optimally. Where the work done by AFRL has used terminal distances between the players as the performance functional, this work expands upon the ATDDG by considering heuristics, the barrier surface, and temporal based strategies. Doing so strengthens the findings of AFRL, lends insight into how the barrier surface affects the players, and produces results that not only lead to a Game of Kind win, but do so while simultaneously minimizing/maximizing time.},

@article{lin2014distributed,
  abstract = {This paper considers a formation control problem for a multiple-UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) system where each UAV is able to exchange information with other UAVs according to a fixed information graph. In this paper, each UAV tries to minimize its own performance index which is chosen independently based on its local information. Because of the UAVs' different objectives, the formation control problem is formulated and solved as a differential game problem. Realizing the incapability of the classical Nash strategy approach in dealing with the distributed information, we propose a novel open-loop Nash strategy design approach for each UAV to implement in a fully distributed manner through estimating its terminal state. An illustrative example of a five-UAV formation control problem is solved under different scenarios.},

@inproceedings{vonmoll2019multiple,
  abstract = {Ensuring border security against potential threats has been a long standing problem and it becomes much more challenging for land borders due to its long distances coupled with terrain variations. In this paper, we consider a scenario in which a team of UAVs (the pursuers)  attempt to prevent an intruder ground vehicle (the evader) from escaping through the border. The ground intruder‚Äôs presence is made known by a laser fence positioned inside the border. Upon detection, the UAVs are activated and given the objective to cooperatively capture the intruder. We formulate the scenario as a zero-sum differential game whereupon all agents exhibit simple motion and the pursuers have a speed advantage. For cases where capture inside the border is possible, the payoff/cost for the pursuers/evader is the distance from capture to the border. The solution to the game is derived based on the geometric properties of the game and verified for the single pursuer case with a border comprised of straight-line segments. This game may contain a dispersal surface which has interesting practical consequences when the optimal strategies are applied in discrete time.},

@article{croft2006social,
  abstract = {In contrast to the substantial number of theoretical papers that have examined the mechanisms by which cooperation may evolve, very few studies have investigated patterns of co-operation in natural animal populations. In the current study, we use a novel approach, social network analysis, to investigate the structure of co-operative interactions in the context of predator inspection in a wild population of guppies (Poecilia reticulata). Female guppies showed social preferences for stable partners, fulfilling a key assumption made by models of reciprocity. In the laboratory, wild female guppies disproportionately engaged in predator inspection with others with whom they had strong social associations. Furthermore, pairs of fish that frequently engaged in predator inspection did so in a particularly co-operative way, potentially reducing costs associated with predator inspection. Taken together, these results provide evidence for assortative interactions forming the basis of co-operation during predator inspection in a natural fish population. The occurrence of highly interconnected social networks between stable partners suggests the existence of co-operation networks in free-ranging populations of the guppy.},

Two distinct scenarios differing in the type of information that the pursuers have about the evader‚Äôs strategy are analyzed. The first scenario involves pursuers that have access to the evader‚Äôs position and velocity at each instant of time, and consequently they follow a constant-bearing strategy. In the second scenario, it is assumed that the pursuers have only information about the evader‚Äôs instantaneous position, and they follow a pure-pursuit strategy. In both these scenarios, the evader has information about the pursuers‚Äô location at every instant of time, and in addition, it also knows their pursuit strategy. The evading strategies maximizing capture time in both scenarios are studied under an optimal control framework. The two scenarios are further analyzed assuming that there is only one active pursuer.

For example, cluster analysis involves construction of convex hulls of sets of points, LSI artwork analysis requires a test for intersection of sets of line segments, computer graphics involves hidden line elimination, and even linear programming can be expressed in terms of intersection of half-spaces. As larger geometric problems are solved on the computer, the need grows for faster algorithms to solve them. The topic of this thesis is the use of geometric transforms as algorithmic tools for constructing fast geometric algorithms. We describe several geometric problems whose solutions illustrate the use of geometric transforms. These include fast algorithms for intersecting half-spaces, constructing Voronoi diagrams, and computing the Euclidean diameter of a set of points. For each of the major transforms we include a set of heuristics to enable the reader to use geometric transforms to solve his own problems. (Author)},

@inproceedings{fuchs2010cooperative,
  abstract = {This paper is motivated by a desire to develop analytical formulations for cooperative defensive strategies against predator(s).We formulate a single-pursuer, two-evader differential game with a novel cost functional. Each of the three agents are modeled as massless particles that move with constant velocity. The pursuer attempts to capture either of the evaders while minimizing its cost. Simultaneously, the evaders strive to maximize the pursuer's cost. The proposed cost functional represents the increased cost to the pursuer when presented with multiple, potentially dangerous targets. It captures the effect of cooperation between the evaders. In order to solve the game, we develop the optimality conditions for the equilibrium strategies. We then integrate the resulting system of ordinary differential equations backwards in time from the terminal conditions to generate the optimal trajectories of the three agent system. The resulting trajectories display cooperative behaviors between the two evaders, which are qualitatively similar to behaviors found in predator-prey interactions in nature. Brief description of singular surfaces is also included.},

  abstract = {This paper reconsiders existence of worst-case Nash equilibria in noncooperative multi-player differential games, this, within an open-loop information structure. We show that these equilibria can be obtained by determining the open-loop Nash equilibria of an associated differential game with an additional initial state constraint. For the special case of linear-quadratic differential games, we derive both necessary and sufficient conditions for solvability of the finite planning horizon problem. In particular, we demonstrate that, unlike in the standard linear-quadratic differential game setting, uniqueness of equilibria may fail to hold. A both necessary and sufficient condition under which there is a unique equilibrium is provided. A sufficient exis- tence condition for a unique equilibrium is derived in terms of a Riccati differential equation. Consequences for control policies are demonstrated in a simple debt stabilization game. ¬© 2016 The Authors. Optimal Control Applications and Methods published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

One wish to partition G into connected components by deleting edges from G so that the total weight of each component is at least l and at most u. Such an ‚Äúalmost uniform‚Äù partition is called an $(l, u) \mbox{-}$ partition. We deal with three problems to find an $(l, u) \mbox{-}$ partition of a given graph. The minimum partition problem is to find an $(l, u) \mbox{-}$ partition with the minimum number of components. The maximum partition problem is defined similarly. The p-partition problem is to find an $(l, u) \mbox{-}$ partition with a fixed number p of components. All these problems are NP-complete or NP-hard even for series-parallel graphs. In this paper we show that both the minimum partition problem and the maximum partition problem can be solved in time O(u 4 n) and the p-partition problem can be solved in time O(p 2 u 4 n) for any series-parallel graph of n vertices. The algorithms can be easily extended for partial k-trees, that is, graphs with bounded tree-width.},

Although capture is inevitable, the Evader wishes to delay capture as long as possible. The optimal trajectories cover the entire state space.

The differential game of border defense is addressed and we focus on the game of degree in the region of the state space where the pursuers are able to win. This work extends classical differential game theory to simultaneously address weapon assignments and multi-player pursuit-evasion scenarios. Saddle-point strategies that provide guaranteed performance for each team regardless of the actual strategies implemented by the opponent are devised. The players' optimal strategies require the co-design of cooperative optimal assignments and optimal guidance laws. A representative measure of performance is proposed and the Value function of the game is obtained. It is shown that the Value function is continuous, continuously differentiable, and that it satisfies the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation - the curse of dimensionality is overcome and the optimal strategies are obtained. The cases of N=M and N>M are considered. In the latter case, cooperative guidance strategies are also developed in order for the pursuers to exploit their numerical advantage. This work provides a foundation to formally analyze complex and high-dimensional conflicts between teams of N pursuers and M evaders by means of differential game theory.},

@inproceedings{vonmoll2014review,
  abstract = {The exhaust gas temperature (EGT) is typically defined as the gas temperature at the exit of the turbine; the sensors used to measure this parameter are considered the most vulnerable elements of the entire turbine engine instrumentation. EGT measurement is considered a key parameter for optimizing fuel economy, diagnosis, and prognosis. The reason is that turbine blade temperature is a good indicator for normal life consumption of that blade. Currently, direct sensor measurements made on turbine modules are limited due to the extremely hot environment. Exhaust gas temperature (EGT) sensors located downstream from the highest temperature sections provide a means to roughly infer the temperatures seen by the turbine blades/disks. But these sensors, which themselves are subject to frequent failures, provide a fairly inaccurate indication of the actual metal temperature profiles. This is of particular importance for high performance military turbine engines where the margin between hot-section operating conditions and material limitations is shrinking. A future state is envisioned that would use emerging pyrometric, fiber optic, and laser-based sensing to accurately assess the condition and life usage of the hot section, on a blade-by-blade basis.},

We represent the environment as a graph with vertex weights and edge lengths. The vertices represent regions of interest, edge lengths give travel times between regions and the vertex weights give the importance of each region. As the robot repeatedly performs a closed walk on the graph, we define the weighted latency of a vertex to be the maximum time between visits to that vertex, weighted by the importance (vertex weight) of that vertex. Our goal is to find a closed walk that minimizes the maximum weighted latency of any vertex. We show that there does not exist a polynomial time algorithm for the problem. We then provide two approximation algorithms; an O(log n)-approximation algorithm and an O(log œÅG)-approximation algorithm, where œÅG is the ratio between the maximum and minimum vertex weights. We provide simulation results which demonstrate that our algorithms can be applied to problems consisting of thousands of vertices and a case study for patrolling a city for crime.},

  abstract = {Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) present an increasingly viable threat vector to the Defense com- munity. Existing response systems are vulnerable to saturation attacks of large swarms of low-cost autonomous vehicles. One method of reducing this threat is the use of an intelligent counter swarm with tactics, navigation and planning capabilities for engaging the adversarial swarm. Though previous studies exist that have produced libraries of basic fighter tactics employable by unmanned fixed-wing aircraft, we are aware of little prior work that explores close-in tactical engagements at a large scale (teams of at least size 10). We examine existing tech- nologies that can be applied in fixed-wing swarm-versus-swarm engagement, including classic pursuit-evasion strategies and the application of Lanchester‚Äôs laws for attrition calculations. Our recent studies center on lever- aging existing manned fighter combat doctrine, and on the benefits of collaboration. We consider experiments in close-air combat against adversaries capable of destroying aerial targets. The following work employs both a Monte Carlo analysis in a simulation environment to measure the effectiveness of several autonomous tactics, as well as an analysis of live flight experiments in swarm competitions with up to 10 vs. 10 scenarios.},

  abstract = {This study examines combinations of different binary and unary operators to construct genetic algorithms for solving the traveling salesperson problem. Uniform order-based crossover, heuristic crossover, and edge recombination, are evaluated with inversion and reciprocal exchange mutations. Edge recombination was valuable in converging in the shortest number of generations, and order-based crossover the best performer in frequency of optimum solutions found. The inversion mutation method produced best averages for all populations, but reciprocal exchange performed well in frequency of optimum solutions. For TSP, inversion is actually the less invasive mutation, disrupting at maximum two edges, while reciprocal change can disrupt four edges. This paper explores application of genetic algorithms to TSP by examining combinations of different algorithms for the binary and unary operators used to generate better solutions and minimize the search space. Three binary and two unary operations were tested.},

We consider pursuers and evaders limited by a maximum speed moving in the two-dimensional plane with obstacles. We then investigate two problems in this domain. In the first, where we are given the starting configuration of pursuers and evaders, we identify all possible paths by the evaders that are not intercepted by pursuers, and the points reachable by the evaders be- fore the pursuers by following these paths. In the second problem, we consider a pursuer forced to maintain visibility with an evader. We construct an example that demonstrates there exists, in addition to the two standard outcomes of the pursuer capturing the evader and the evader losing sight of the pursuer, a third tie outcome, where the pursuer never loses sight of the evader, but the evader can also avoid cap- ture indefinitely. We give the conditions under which each of these three outcomes occur for our specific situation.},

This work presents a decentralized, real-time algorithm for cooperative pursuit of a single evader by multiple pursuers in bounded, simply-connected planar domains. The algorithm is based on minimizing the area of the generalized Voronoi partition of the evader. The pursuers share state information but compute their inputs independently. No assumptions are made about the evader‚Äôs control strategies other than requiring the evader control inputs to conform to a speed limit. Proof of guaranteed capture is shown when the domain is convex and the players‚Äô motion models are kinematic.

GFTs are a natural evolution to Genetic Fuzzy Systems, in which multiple cascading fuzzy systems are optimized by genetic methods. In this problem a team of UCAV's must traverse through a battle space and counter enemy threats, utilize imperfect systems, cope with uncertainty, and successfully destroy critical targets. Enemy threats take the form of Air Interceptors (AIs), Surface to Air Missile (SAM) sites, and Electronic WARfare (EWAR) stations. Simultaneous training and tuning a multitude of Fuzzy Inference Systems (FISs), with varying degrees of connectivity, is performed through the use of an optimized Genetic Algorithm (GA). The GFT presented in this study, the Learning Enhanced Tactical Handling Algorithm (LETHA), is able to create controllers with the presence of deep learning, resilience to uncertainties, and adaptability to changing scenarios. These resulting deterministic fuzzy controllers are easily understandable by operators, are of very high performance and efficiency, and are consistently capable of completing new and different missions not trained for.},

However, there is no general agreement about which one is more appropriate. This letter proposes an E-Spiral algorithm for accurate photogrammetry that considers the camera sensor and the flight altitude to apply the overlapping necessary to guarantee the mission success. The algorithm uses an energy model to set different optimal speeds for straight segments of the path, reducing the energy consumption. We also propose an improvement for the energy model to predict the overall energy of the paths. We compare E-Spiral and E-BF algorithms in simulations over more than 3500 polygonal areas with different characteristics, such as vertices, irregularity, and size. Results showed that E-Spiral outperforms E-BF in all the cases, providing an effective energy saving even in the worst scenario with a percentage improvement of$10.37%$up to the best case with$\text16.1%$of improvement. Real flights performed with a quadrotor state the effectiveness of the E-Spiral over E-BF in two areas, presenting an improvement of$\text9%$in the time and$\text7.7%$in the energy.

  abstract = {Blimps are a promising platform for aerial robotics and have been studied extensively for this purpose. Unlike other aerial vehicles, blimps are relatively safe and also possess the ability to loiter for long periods. These advantages, however, have been difficult to exploit because blimp dynamics are complex and inherently non-linear. The classical approach to system modeling represents the system as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) based on Newtonian principles. A more recent modeling approach is based on representing state transitions as a Gaussian process (GP). In this paper, we present a general technique for system identification that combines these two modeling approaches into a single formulation. This is done by training a Gaussian process on the residual between the non-linear model and ground truth training data. The result is a GP-enhanced model that provides an estimate of uncertainty in addition to giving better state predictions than either ODE or GP alone. We show how the GP-enhanced model can be used in conjunction with reinforcement learning to generate a blimp controller that is superior to those learned with ODE or GP models alone.},

The probabilities used to encode the information about the environment are typically assumed to be exactly known in the search theory literature, but they are often the result of prior information that is both erroneous and delayed, and will likely be poorly known to mission designers. Our previous work developed a new framework that accounted for the uncertainty in the probability maps for stationary targets, and this paper extends the approach to more realistic dynamic environments. The dynamic case considers probabilistic target motion, creating uncertain probability maps (UPMs) that take into account both poor knowledge of the probabilities and the propagation of their uncertainty through the environment. A key result of this paper is a new algorithm for implementing UPM's in real-time, and it is shown in various simulations that this algorithm leads to more cautious information updates that are less susceptible to false alarms. The paper also provides insights on the impact of the design parameters on the responsiveness of the new algorithm. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new framework},

In this game, the pursuer attempts to minimize the total capture time of all the evaders while the evaders, as a team, cooperate to maximize this time. The information pattern considered here is conservative towards the evaders. One important advantage of this open-loop approach over the geometrical approach in the literature is that it provides guaranteed survival time of the evader team for all initial conditions, without the limitation that the pursuer must capture the evaders in a specific sequence. Another advantage of this approach is that under the open-loop framework, we can quickly generate controls for multiple players that the classical Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) approach, due to its computational infeasibility, cannot handle. We also relax the conservatism inherent in this open-loop formulation by presenting an iterative open-loop scheme of the evaders' evasion strategy. Simulations for the open-loop, the iterative open-loop as well as the HJI approaches are presented, with the results on performance analyzed and discussed.},

Since poorly coordinated transfers can increase waiting times significantly, it is especially important (when constructing timetables) to synchronize schedules carefully in cases of larger headways. Poorly coordinated transfers can also reduce the number of passengers using public transit as a result of switching to competitor modes. When designing synchronized schedules it is necessary to try to minimize the total waiting times of all passengers at transfer nodes in a transit network. Often only approximate numbers of transfer passengers are known. This paper develops a model for schedule synchronization where the number of transfer passengers is only approximately known. The model is based on the Fuzzy Ant System that represents a combination of the Ant Colony System and Fuzzy Logic.},

The objective is to minimize the maximum weighted revisit time over all the sites in a cyclicly repeating walk. In general, the optimal length of the walk is not known, so this method (like the exact methods) assume some fixed length. Exact methods for solving the problem have recently been put forth, however, in the absence of additional heuristics, the exact method scales poorly for problems with more than 10 sites or so. By using a genetic algorithm, performance and computation time can be traded off depending on the application. The main contributions are a novel chromosome encoding scheme and genetic operators for cyclic walks which may visit sites more than once. Examples show that the performance is comparable to exact methods with better scalability.},

@article{park2016performance,
  abstract = {This paper is focused on the development and analysis of suboptimal decision algorithms for a collection of robots that assist a remotely located operator in perimeter surveillance. The operator is tasked with the classification of incursions across the perimeter. whenever there is an incursion into the perimeter, an unattended ground sensor (UGS) in the vicinity, signals an alert. A robot services the alert by visiting the alert location, collecting information, e.g., photo and video imagery, and transmitting it to the operator. The accuracy of operator's classification depends on the volume and freshness of information gathered and provided by the robots at locations where incursions occur. There are two competing objectives for a robot: it needs to spend adequate time at an alert location to collect evidence for aiding the operator in accurate classification but it also needs to service other alerts as soon as possible, so that the evidence collected is relevant. The decision problem is to determine the optimal amount of time a robot must spend servicing an alert. The incursions are stochastic and their statistics are assumed to be known. This problem can be posed as a Markov Decision Problem. However, even for two robots and five UGS locations, the number of states is of the order of billions rendering exact dynamic programming methods intractable. Approximate dynamic programming (ADP) via linear programming (LP) provides a way to approximate the value function and derive suboptimal strategies. The novel feature of this paper is the derivation of a tractable lower bound via LP and the construction of a suboptimal policy whose performance improves upon the lower bound. An illustrative perimeter surveillance example corroborates the results derived in this paper. Note to Practitioners-In practice, one often encounters the curse of dimensionality in the application of dynamic programming to determine optimal policies for controlled Markov chains. This is true, in- particular, for dynamic scheduling problems involving multiple robots/servers and queues of tasks that arrive in a stochastic fashion. The computation of value function, critical to the determination of optimal policies, is nearly impractical. Hence, one must settle for suboptimal policies. Two natural questions arise: (1) How does one construct a suboptimal policy? (2) How ‚Äúgood‚Äù is the constructed suboptimal policy? A common strategy to tackle the first problem is to approximate the value function and construct a suboptimal policy that is greedy with respect to the approximate value function. Typically, an approximate value function is constructed via a choice of basis functions. The question of how to choose the basis functions systematically for any problem is a difficult one; usually, the structure of the problem at hand is exploited in the construction of basis functions. The same approach is taken here and the state space is partitioned based on the reward structure and the optimal cost-to-go or value function is approximated by a constant over each partition. The second question is related to the first question in the sense that one needs to construct bounds for the performance of a suboptimal policy. In this paper, we construct upper and lower bounds for the value function (optimal performance) and use the lower bound as an approximate value function. Furthermore, we also show that the resulting suboptimal policy comes with a performance guarantee, in that it improves on the lower bound, it was derived from. Literature is replete with techniques for computing upper bounds; however, there is little work on lower bounds, which are also required for bounding the suboptimality of the policy. One encounters prohibitively large number of constraints in the case of computing an upper bound and has to deal with disjunctive linear inequalities in the case of a lower bound. The problem structure is exploi},

@article{awheda2017residual,
  abstract = {In this work, we propose a new fuzzy reinforcement learning algorithm for differential games that have continuous state and action spaces. The proposed algorithm uses function approximation systems whose parameters are updated differently from the updating mechanisms used in the algorithms proposed in the literature. Unlike the algorithms presented in the literature which use the direct algorithms to update the parameters of their function approximation systems, the proposed algorithm uses the residual gradient value iteration algorithm to tune the input and output parameters of its function approximation systems. It has been shown in the literature that the direct algorithms may not converge to an answer in some cases, while the residual gradient algorithms are always guaranteed to converge to a local minimum. The proposed algorithm is called the residual gradient fuzzy actor‚Äìcritic learning (RGFACL) algorithm. The proposed algorithm is used to learn three different pursuit‚Äìevasion differential games. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed RGFACL algorithm outperforms the performance of the fuzzy actor‚Äìcritic learning and the Q-learning fuzzy inference system algorithms in terms of convergence and speed of learning.},

  abstract = {An interest in border defense, surveillance, and interdiction has recently increased for a variety of reasons related to issues of illegal immigration, terrorism, drug/human trafficking, and other potential threats. UAVs offer an attractive alternative to supporting and defending various threats at borders. This article applies a differential game to define a border defense scenario where one UAV (pursuer) seeks to capture two intruders (evaders) before they reach a designated border. The evaders can be UAVs, marine/ground vehicles, or human agents, but have a lower maximum speed than the pursuer throughout the game. Simple motion is assumed for the pursuer and evaders with complete state information shared across all agents.  The game is played within a rectangular area with a parallel top and bottom border of length L and left and right borders with a length of W, for a game aspect ratio of L/W. The value of the game is the minimum distance to the bottom border achieved by the evaders at any time before capture of both evaders. Within the region where the pursuer wins, the game of degree is explored and the optimal policy for both the evaders and pursuers is derived using geometric},

The attackers attempt to win the game by sending at least M of them (1 ‚â§ M ‚â§ N) to a target location while the defenders try to prevent the attackers from doing so by capturing them. The analysis of this game plays an important role in collision avoidance, motion planning, and aircraft control, among other applications involving cooperative agents. The high dimensionality of the game makes computing an optimal solution for either side intractable when N > 1. The solution is difficult even when N = 1. To address this issue, we present an efficient, approximate solution to the 1 vs. 1 problem. We call the approximate solution the ‚Äúpath defense solution‚Äù, which is conservative towards the defenders. This serves as a building block for an approximate solution of the multiplayer game. Compared to the classical Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs approach for solving the 1 vs. 1 game, our new method is orders of magnitude faster, and scales much better with the number of players.},

@article{fuchs2017generalized,
  abstract = {This paper is motivated by the desire to develop optimal defensive control strategies that discourage an attacker from engaging in attack while simultaneously encouraging retreat. We develop a general, two-player, differential game in which one player represents an attacker and the opposing player represents the defender. The attacker possesses superior dynamics such that it is capable of terminating the game either in engagement or retreat as it so chooses. The defender is incapable of directly preventing engagement. Instead, the defender uses the manipulation of the attacker's utility function as a form of indirect control in an attempt to make retreat a more attractive option over engagement. The solution to the overall engage or retreat differential game is found by solving two related optimization problems: the differential game of engagement and the optimal constrained retreat. The equilibrium open-loop control strategies and resulting game values of the attack or retreat game are expressed in terms of the solutions to these subproblems. Within the optimal constrained retreat problem, a value function constraint is imposed in order to prevent the attacker from moving into regions where engagement becomes optimal. This leads to regions of constrained retreat which we refer to as escort regions.},

  abstract = {The intersection between machine learning and control theory is emerging rapidly; many rich applications are currently being developed. This report explores one particular area of interest: trajectory optimization. The Linear Quadratic Regulator and Linear Quadratic Gaussian algorithms are introduced as predecessors to the Iterative Linear Quadratic Gaussian (iLQG) algorithm, which is re-derived in this report and demonstrated on 3 systems of interest: cartpole, double cartpole, and quadrotor. iLQG is robust and widely applicable to a vast number of different systems. Probabilistic Differential Dynamic Programming (PDDP) is introduced as an important extension to iLQG which incorporates uncertainty into the trajectory optimization process. The conceptual advances presented in this report were centered around the use of a Gaussian Process Regression Network (GPRN) to represent the unknown system dynamics in lieu of the standard Gaussian Process representation employed by PDDP. GPRNs offer a more sophisticated noise model and a more adaptive regression framework. More speciffcally, they incorporate input-dependent noise and signal correlation between multiple outputs. This should enhance the predictive capability of the algorithm to represent the unknown system dynamics. Work remains on fully incorporating GPRN into a PDDP-like algorithm: effort continues in the areas of understanding variational Bayes and variational message passing for learning GPRN hyperparameters, and in creating a MATLAB implementation.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we address the pursuit/evasion problem of capturing an omnidirectional evader using a Differential Drive Robot (DDR) in an obstacle-free environment. The goal of the evader is to keep the pursuer farther than the capture distance for as long as possible and for the pursuer the goal is to capture the evader as soon as possible. In [1] an open-loop time-optimal strategy is proposed for this pursuit/evasion problem. In [2] a state feedback-based time-optimal motion policy for the DDR is provided. The time-optimal strategies obtained in [1] are in Nash equilibrium, meaning that any unilateral deviation of a player from the optimal strategies does not provide it a benefit in its payoff. However, Nash equilibrium does not tell if one player deviates from its optimal policy then, does there exist a new strategy for the other player that can take advantage of such deviation? If so, which is the required information to improve the payoff compared with the worst case scenario? In this paper we address those questions, analysing the scenario in which the players deviate from their optimal controls. We show that when the evader deviates from its optimal speed there are cases where there exists a new pursuer motion strategy that reduces the time to capture the evader. The shown cases where the time to capture the evader is reduced require more information about the evader's state. Nevertheless, there are also cases in which despite the availability of new information, the pursuer must stick to the worst case strategy, otherwise it cannot capture the evader.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of the pursuit of a maneuvering target by a group of pursuers distributed in the plane. This pursuit problem is solved by associating it with a Voronoi-like partitioning problem that characterizes the set of initial positions from which the target can be intercepted by a given pursuer faster than any other pursuer from the same group. In the formulation of this partitioning problem, the target does not necessarily travel along prescribed trajectories, as it is typically assumed in the literature, but, instead, it can apply an ‚Äúevading‚Äù strategy in an effort to delay or, if possible, escape capture. We characterize an approximate solution to this problem by associating it with a standard Voronoi partitioning problem. Subsequently, we propose a relay pursuit strategy, that is, a special group pursuit scheme such that, at each instant of time, only one pursuer is assigned the task of capturing the maneuvering target. During the course of the relay pursuit, the pursuer‚Äìtarget assignment changes dynamically with time based on the (time varying) proximity relations between the pursuers and the target. This proximity information is encoded in the solution of the Voronoi-like partitioning problem. Simulation results are presented to highlight the theoretical developments.},

Hovering guards discern heterospecifics from conspecifics, and standing guards discern conspecific invaders from nestmates. Using a value-based multi-agent simulation, we find that, when heterospecific invaders deduct much more value from the defended resources than conspecifics, a heterogeneous defense force preserves value most effectively. Consequently, when facing heterogeneous invaders, focus should be on building effective mixtures of heterogeneous defensive agents instead of enhancing capabilities of homogeneous robotic swarms.

We first revisit Isaacs' "Two Cutters and a Fugitive Ship" pursuit-evasion differential game in the Euclidean plane where two pursuers, say cutters, chase a fugitive ship. All move with simple motion, the speeds of the cutters each being greater than that of the fugitive ship, the evader. Coincidence with either one, or both pursuers, is capture, and time of capture is the payoff/cost.  It is shown that group/swarm pursuit is fundamentally shaped by two critical pursuers and sometimes by just one critical pursuer, and this irrespective of the size N of the pursuit pack. Thus, the pursuit devolves into pure pursuit by one of the players or into a pincer movement maneuver by two players who engage the evader, a menage a trois.

  abstract = {Design studies rely on sensitivities of the system measures of effectiveness to the system design variables. Agent-based modeling and simulation techniques provide one approach to determine these sensitivities. In agent-based formulations, implementing meaningful agent behaviors is critical to achieving a realistic mapping from the system design variables to the measures of effectiveness. Traditionally, subject matter experts aid in defining these behaviors, or optimal behaviors are determined analytically. In this work, a method for generating near-optimal agent behaviors at the engagement level is presented, borrowing concepts from reinforcement learning. The approach leverages deterministic policy gradient algorithms in an actor-critic construct using artificial neural networks as nonlinear function approximators to define agent behaviors in a continuous state and action space. This approach mitigates the reliance on subject matter expertise and avoids the rigidity and time consuming nature of solving an optimal control problem. The developed approach is applied to the widely studied active target defense differential game where the learned behaviors are validated against the optimal control problem solution presented in the literature. Permutations of the active target defense differential game provide implementation in a single agent case and a much more challenging multi-agent case. In both the single and multi-agent cases, learned behaviors are nearly identical to the optimal result. With learned behaviors providing high quality near-optimal behaviors, the applicability of reinforcement learning techniques to define agent behavior has been demonstrated at the proof of concept level.},

  abstract = {The coordination of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to carry out surveys is a major challenge for emergency responders. In particular, UAVs have to Ô¨Çy over kilometre-scale areas while trying to discover casualties as quickly as possible. However, an increase in the availability of real-time data about a disaster from sources such as crowd reports or satellites presents a valuable source of information to drive the planning of UAV Ô¨Çight paths over a space in order to discover people who are in danger. Nevertheless challenges remain when planning over the very large action spaces that result. To this end, we introduce the survivor discovery problem and present as our solution, the Ô¨Årst example of a factored coordinated Monte Carlo tree search algorithm to perform decentralised path planning for multiple coordinated UAVs. Our evaluation against standard benchmarks show that our algorithm, Co-MCTS, is able to Ô¨Ånd more casualties faster than standard approaches by 10% or more on simulations with real-world data from the 2010 Haiti earthquake.},

@inproceedings{kalyanam2018scalable,
  abstract = {We are interested in the persistent surveillance of an area of interest comprised of stations/ data nodes. The data collection task is undertaken by a UAV which autonomously executes the mission. Each node has a priority/ weight associated with it that characterizes the relative importance between timely collection of data from the nodes. In this context, a prudent performance metric is the maximal weighted time between consecutive visits to each node. We wish to minimize the maximum of this metric among all nodes for a given cycle length. Here, the cycle length refers to the total number of nodes (including repeats) visited per cycle. When the cycle length is greater than the number of nodes, some nodes, arguably ones with a higher priority, will be visited more often. We pose the problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP), that computes the optimal visit sequence and number of visits to each node for a given cycle length. Not surprisingly, the exact method is not scalable with the number of nodes and the cycle length. We therefore present sub-optimal methods  by directly enforcing a pre-specified number of visits to each node. We present an iterative scheme that computes solutions for increasing cycle length with a recipe for updating the number of visits based on the solution from the previous iteration. We compare the optimal and sub-optimal iterative schemes and show that the sub-optimal scheme is an order of magnitude faster than the optimal scheme with minimal loss in performance.},

Given a set of strategically important locations (viewpoints) with different priorities, our patrolling strategy consists of 1) constructing a tour through the viewpoints, and 2) driving the robots along the tour in a coordinated way. As performance criteria, we consider the weighted refresh time, i.e., the longest time interval between any two visits of a viewpoint, weighted by the viewpoint's priority. We consider the design of both optimal trajectories and distributed control laws for the robots to converge to optimal trajectories. First, we propose a patrolling strategy and we characterize its performance as a function of the environment and the viewpoints priorities. Second, we restrict our attention to the problem of patrolling a nonintersecting tour, and we describe a team trajectory with minimum weighted refresh time. Third, for the tour patrolling problem and for two distinct communication scenarios, namely the Passing and the Neighbor-Broadcast communication models, we develop distributed algorithms to steer the robots toward a minimum weighted refresh time team trajectory. Finally, we show the effectiveness and robustness of our control algorithms via simulations and experiments.},

@article{vonmoll2019robust,
  abstract = {Analysis of the pursuit-evasion differential game consisting of multiple pursuers and single evader with simple motion is difficult due to the wellknown curse of dimensionality. Policies have been proposed for this scenario, and we show that these policies are Global Stackelberg equilibrium strategies.  However we also show that they are not saddle point equilibria in the feedback sense. The argument is twofold: there are cases where the saddle point condition is violated, and cases where the strategy profiles are not time consistent (subgame perfect). The issue of capturability is explored, and sufficient conditions for guaranteed capture are provided. A new pursuit policy is proposed which guarantees capture while also providing an upper bound for capture time. The Evader policy corresponding to the Global Stackelberg equilibrium is shown to provide a lower bound for capture time. Thus these policies are robust from the Pursuer and Evader perspectives, respectively, should they implement them. Several other interesting pursuit and evasion policies are explored and compared with the robust policies in a series of experiments.},

While many have gotten away with using just the mathematical symbols when doing science and engineering with pen and paper, the modern world of numerical computing requires each physical parameter to have a numerical value, otherwise one cannot get started with the computations. For example, in the simplest possible transient heat conduction simulation, a case relevant for a real physical material needs values for the heat capacity, the density, and the heat conduction coefficient of the material. In addition, relevant values must be chosen for initial and boundary temperatures as well as the size of the material. With a dimensionless mathematical model, as explained in Chapter 3.2, no physical quantities need to be assigned (!). Not only is this a simplification of great convenience, as one simulation is valid for any type of material, but it also actually increases the understanding of the physical problem.},

We analyze a multi-stage, two-player game in which one player represents an attacker with superior dynamic characteristics and the other player represents a team consisting of a mobile, high-value target and N protective agents. At the start of the game, the attacker must decide whether to engage the target or retreat. The defending team must then decide whether to maximize or minimize the attacker's cost in response. These decisions are referred to as the players' intent. After each side has selected an intent, a differential pursuit-evasion game is played in which the value represents the integral cost to the attacker. Within the differential game, the terminal conditions and the players' optimal control strategies are dictated by the previous intent selections. We obtain the optimal intent strategies in terms of the differential game values and relevant bonus and penalty values. We solve the differential games by developing the optimality conditions for the equilibrium control strategies. We show that for certain conditions, the defenders should cooperate with the attacker so that retreat becomes the most attractive option; thereby, fulfilling the defensive goal of protecting the high-value target.},

The guidance concept is based on the geometrical principle that constrains the interceptor to follow a circular trajectory to the target. The concept is extended for moving targets, varying interceptor speed, and a constrained field of view of the interceptor. Implementation is demonstrated for a salvo-attack scenario where, by scheduling the launches of the interceptors, not only the desired impact time but also the desired impact angles are enforced. Application of the guidance concept for standoff tracking of stationary and moving targets is also demonstrated. Performance in various scenarios is investigated via nonlinear simulations.},

  abstract = {A novel pursuit-evasion differential game involving three agents is considered. An Attacker missile is pursuing a Target aircraft. The Target aircraft is aided by a Defender missile launched by, say, the wingman, to intercept the Attacker before it reaches the Target aircraft. Thus, a team is formed by the Target and the Defender which cooperate to maximize the separation between the Target aircraft and the point where the Attacker missile is intercepted by the Defender missile, while at the same time the Attacker tries to minimize said distance. A long-range Beyond Visual Range engagement which is in line with current CONcepts of OPeration is envisaged, and it is therefore assumed that the players have simple motion kinematics √° la Isaacs. Also, the speed of the Attacker is equal to the speed of the Defender and the latter is interested in point capture. It is also assumed that at all time the Attacker is aware of the Defender‚Äôs position, i.e., it is a perfect information game. The analytic/closed-form solution of the target defense pursuit-evasion differential game delineates the state space region where the Attacker can reach the Target without being intercepted by the Defender, thus disposing of the Game of Kind. The target defense Game of Degree is played in the remaining state space. The analytic solution of the Game of Degree yields the agents‚Äô optimal state feedback strategies, that is, the instantaneous heading angles for the Target and the Defender team to maximize the terminal separation between Target and Attacker at the instant of interception of the Attacker by the Defender, and also the instantaneous optimal heading for the Attacker to minimize said separation. Their calculation hinges on the real-time solution of a quartic equation. In this paper we contribute to the solution of a differential game with three states‚Äîan additional example to the, admittedly small, repertoire of pursuit-evasion differential games in 3-D which can be solved in closed form.},

The framework of Markov games allows us to widen this view to include multiple adaptive agents with interacting or competing goals.

This paper studies a three-player differential pursuit-evasion game in which a pursuer aims to capture a fleeing evader while a third player, the defender, cooperates with the latter by attempting to intercept or delay the pursuer to avoid capture. Our analysis considers time-varying dynamics and allows the presence of possibly moving obstacles in the domain. We apply a recent theoretical result to express the outcome of the game through the solution of a double-obstacle Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs variational inequality, and propose a novel approach to break down the problem into two simpler two-player games with dynamic targets and constraints, which can be solved at a much lower cost. Although conservative, this method guarantees correctness of the computed winning region and strategy for the evader-defender team when a feasible escape solution is found. We demonstrate both the full solution and the approximation method through a numerical example.},

To motivate our methods, we apply them to an adversarial game between two teams of vehicles. One team is governed by simple rules and the other by our algorithms. In our study of this game we found phase transitions, showing that the task assignment problem is most difficult to solve when the capabilities of the adversaries are comparable.

In this paper we exhibit a class of single evader-multiple pursuers games for which a reduction in complexity of this nature is possible. The target set is expressed as a union of smaller, sub-target sets. The individual differential games are obtained by substituting a sub-target set in place of the original target and are simpler because of geometric features of the dynamics and constraints. We give conditions under which the value function of the original problem can be characterized as the lower envelope of the value functions for the simpler problems and show how optimal strategies can be constructed from those for the simpler problems. The methodology is illustrated by several examples.},

@article{morrison1962multiple,
  abstract = {The common techniques for solving two-point boundary value problems can be classified as either "shooting" or "finite difference" methods. Central to a shooting method is the ability to integrate the differential equations as an initial value problem with guesses for the unknown initial values. This ability is not required with a finite difference method, for the unknowns are considered to be the values of the true solution at a number of interior mesh points. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages. One serious shortcoming of shooting becomes apparent when, as happens altogether too often, the differential equations are so unstable that they "blow up" before the initial value problem can be completely integrated. This can occur even in the face of extremely accurate guesses for the initial values. Hence, shooting seems to offer no hope for some problems. A finite difference method does have a chance for it tends to keep a firm hold on the entire solution at once. The purpose of this note is to point out a compromising procedure which endows shooting-type methods with this particular advantage of finite difference methods. For such problems, then, all hope need not be abandoned for shooting methods. This is desirable because shooting methods are generally faster than finite difference methods.},

An assumptiom is made that the solution (game value) is nonsmooth on some hypersurface. Local necessary conditions in the form of equalities and inequalities are obtained for viscosity solution under different assumptions about the behaviour of the optimal paths in the vicinity of singular surface. The singular surfaces are investigated, which contain (as equivocal or focal ones) or not (dispersal one) the optimal singular paths [2,3]. Using the equality-conditions and singular charactristics technique [4] the equations of motion for the former surfaces are obtained. These equations appear to be not of Hamiltonian type but more general. Some results of this paper are obtained using other approaches in [4,5]; their connection with the properties of viscosity solutions is stated here.},

  abstract = {There are two possible ways for integrating fuzzy logic and evolutionary algorithms. The first one involves the application of evolutionary algorithms for solving optimization and search problems related with fuzzy systems, obtaining genetic fuzzy systems. The second one concerns the use of fuzzy tools and fuzzy logic-based techniques for modelling different evolutionary algorithm components and adapting evolutionary algorithm control parameters, with the goal of improving performance. The evolutionary algorithms resulting from this integration are called fuzzy evolutionary algorithms. In this chapter, we shortly introduce genetic fuzzy systems and fuzzy evolutionary algorithms, giving a short state of the art, and sketch our vision of some hot current trends and prospects. In essence, we paint a complete picture of these two lines of research with the aim of showing the benefits derived from the synergy between evolutionary algorithms and fuzzy logic.},

At each decision stage, the incoming task has known value. However, upon allocating a resource, a task is completed with probability less than one. Furthermore, the decision maker is informed about the task completion status via an error-prone feedback mechanism that is subject to both type I and type II classification errors. The decision maker may choose to reallocate a resource to the current task or move on to the next task in the sequence. We show that a resource is allocated if and only if the expected reward from a task exceeds a threshold.

  abstract = {In this article, a stochastic optimal control problem involving an unmanned aerial vehicle flying patrols around a perimeter is considered. To determine the optimal control policy, one has to solve a Markov decision problem, whose large size renders exact dynamic programming methods intractable. Therefore, a state aggregation based approximate linear programming method is used instead, to construct provably good suboptimal patrol policies. The state space is partitioned and the optimal cost-to-go or value function is restricted to be a constant over each partition. The resulting restricted system of linear inequalities embeds a family of Markov chains of lower dimension, one of which can be used to construct a lower bound on the optimal value function. In general, the construction of a lower bound requires the solution to a combinatorial problem. But the perimeter patrol problem exhibits a special structure that enables tractable linear programming formulation for the lower bound. This is demonstrated and numerical results that corroborate the efficacy of the proposed methodology are also provided.},

In this paper, we consider a scenario in which a team of UAVs (the pursuers) attempt to prevent an intruder ground vehicle (the evader) from escaping through the border. The ground intruder's presence is made known by a laser fence positioned inside the border. Upon detection, the UAVs are activated and given the objective to cooperatively capture the intruder. We formulate the scenario as a zero-sum differential game whereupon all agents exhibit simple motion and the pursuers have a speed advantage. For cases where capture inside the border is possible, the payoff/cost for the pursuers/evader is the distance from capture to the border. The solution to the game is derived based on the geometric properties of the game and verified for the single pursuer case with a border comprised of straight-line segments. This game may contain a dispersal surface which has interesting practical consequences when the optimal strategies are applied in discrete time.},

  abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) and optimal control of systems with continuous states and actions require approximation techniques in most interesting cases. In this article, we introduce Gaussian process dynamic programming (GPDP), an approximate value function-based RL algorithm. We consider both a classic optimal control problem, where problem-specific prior knowledge is available, and a classic RL problem, where only very general priors can be used. For the classic optimal control problem, GPDP models the unknown value functions with Gaussian processes and generalizes dynamic programming to continuous-valued states and actions. For the RL problem, GPDP starts from a given initial state and explores the state space using Bayesian active learning. To design a fast learner, available data have to be used efficiently. Hence, we propose to learn probabilistic models of the a priori unknown transition dynamics and the value functions on the fly. In both cases, we successfully apply the resulting continuous-valued controllers to the under-actuated pendulum swing up and analyze the performances of the suggested algorithms. It turns out that GPDP uses data very efficiently and can be applied to problems, where classic dynamic programming would be cumbersome.},

@thesis{fuchs2012cooperative,
  abstract = {The protection of vulnerable, high-value assets has been a challenge throughout history. These high-value targets may be fixed, mobile, or in the cloud. In any case, it is necessary to deploy and effectively utilize defensive assets in an attempt to neutralize an attack if it occurs, or make the prospect of further engagement so unappealing that the attackers stand down and retreat. My research focused on two aspects of applying game theoretic methods to the development of defensive strategies. The first aspect of my research utilized tools from differential game theory to develop cooperative, defensive control strategies against a superior, mobile attacker. It was shown that through cooperation, the defending agents can combine their resources and make engagement more costly to the attacker than if they acted independently. A hierarchical attack-retreat game was then developed that incorporates the concept of player intent. This game demonstrated that it is sometimes optimal for the defending player to cooperate with the attacker in order to encourage retreat. Although cooperation can encourage retreat, cooperating at the wrong time can actually assist an attacker in engagement. For this reason, a modified differential game with a value function constraint was developed to prevent the attacker from moving the state of the system to a region where engagement is optimal. The second aspect of my research focused on developing an analytic framework to quantitatively capture and describe concepts of deception. A generic two-player, 10 zero-sum game was developed that incorporated deceptive tactics to corrupt a stochastic sensor network. The stochastic sensor network provides one player an informational advantage over its opponent. Using this framework, an illustrative example was designed and examined to describe a well-known, qualitative principle in the deception field known as the ‚ÄúJones‚Äô Lemma‚Äù. A new sequential variant of the Colonel Blotto game was also developed that included a deterministic sensor network.},

In particular, it is shown that if the center ofC is constrained to lie in an arbitrary convexn-gon, an0(n logn) algorithm can still be obtained.

In this scenario, the observer is endowed with a nonzero radius of observation within which he strives at keeping the target for as long as possible. Using the calculus of variations we pose and solve the optimal control problem, solving for the heading of the observer which maximizes the amount of time the target remains inside the radius of observation. Utilizing the optimal observer heading we compute the exposure time based upon the angle by which the target is initially captured. Presented, along with an example, are the zero-time of exposure heading, maximum time of observation heading, and proof that observation is persistent under optimal control.},

@article{li2011defending,
  abstract = {Techniques based on pursuit-evasion (PE) games are often applied in military operations of autonomous vehicles (AV) in the presence of mobile targets. Recently with increasing use of AVs, new scenarios emerge such as surveillance and persistent area denial. Compared with PE games, the actual roles of the pursuer and the evader have changed. In these emerging scenarios the evader acts as an intruder striking at some asset; at the same time the pursuer tries to destroy the intruder to protect the asset. Due to the presence of an asset, the PE game model with two sets of players (pursuers and evaders) is no longer adequate. We call this new problem a game of defending an asset(s) (DA). In this paper we study DA games under the framework of a linear quadratic (LQ) formulation. Three different DA games are addressed: 1) defending a stationary asset, 2) defending a moving asset with an arbitrary trajectory, and 3) defending an escaping asset. Equilibrium game strategies of the players are derived for each case. A repetitive scheme is proposed for implementation of the LQ strategies, and we demonstrate with simulations that the LQ strategies based on the repetitive implementation can provide good control guidance laws for DA games.},

It is shown that traditional means of differential game analysis is difficult for this scenario. But simple motion and min-max time to capture plus the two-person extension to Pontryagin's maximum principle imply straight-line motion at maximum speed which forms the basis of the solution using a geometric approach. Safe evader paths and policies are defined which guarantee the evader can reach its destination without getting captured by any of the pursuers, provided its destination satisfies some constraints. A linear program is used to characterize the solution and subsequently the saddle-point is computed numerically. We replace the numerical procedure with a more analytical geometric approach based on Voronoi diagrams after observing a pattern in the numerical results. The solutions derived are open-loop optimal, meaning the strategies are a saddle-point equilibrium in the open-loop sense.},

The task is undertaken by a set of heterogeneous UAVs which autonomously execute the mission. In addition to geographically distributed tasks, the mission may also include a central node (control target), where data collected from the different targets need to be delivered. In this context, the performance of the system, in addition to the desired revisit rate of the tasks may also entail minimizing the delay in delivering the data collected from a target/task to the central node. We detail, in this paper, a completely autonomous Persistent, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (PISR) System, that addresses the mission requirements. In particular, we focus on practical considerations in terms of scalable optimization and heuristic methods that solve the underlying problem and also discuss the on-board implementation of the chosen optimization schema. We provide details on an in-house software framework that enables easy implementation of the optimization algorithms on commercial drones. To solve the problem, we consider three different optimization schemes based on branch and bound (tree search), MILP formulation and Dynamic Programming. We compare and contrast the three approaches with details on the respective benefits and pitfalls and also touch upon easily implementable heuristic methods motivated by the optimal solution.},

@article{ramseyestimating,
  abstract = {Presence‚Äìabsence (detection/non-detection) data are routinely collected in wildlife studies where identification of individuals is impossible or impractical and where the detection method may be able to detect only the presence of an individual rather than a count (e.g., track or scat surveys). Estimating population density from presence‚Äìabsence data usually is assumed to be difficult or impossible unless certain restrictive assumptions are made or supplementary information is collected. Recently, Chandler and Royle (2013) presented an extension of a spatially explicit capture‚Äìrecapture model that estimates population density from spatially replicated counts in unmarked populations. We extended the model of Chandler and Royle (2013) to situations where only presence‚Äìabsence data can be collected. The model assumes that individuals can be detected at multiple sample units, producing spatially correlated detections. A spatially explicit model of the detection process is then fit to the correlated detection data using Bayesian methods. We report on the performance of the model using simulation and illustrate its use with a practical example estimating the abundance and density of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) from remote camera surveys in the Grampians National Park in southeastern Australia. Results from simulations suggest the model produces unbiased estimates of density if device spacing is less than the radial length of a typical home range and the number of encounter occasions is high (i.e., at least 10). Application of the model to camera detection data from foxes in the Grampians National Park resulted in an estimated density of 0.22 foxes/km2 (95% CI: 0.16‚Äì0.53). For this dataset, precision of the density and detection parameter estimates were increased by the use of an informative prior distribution for the home-range-scale parameter. The current model should apply widely to a range of sampling situations that result in spatially correlated detection/non-detection data such as bait take, scat surveys, tracking stations, and chew cards, to name a few. ¬© 2015 The Wildlife Society.},

@article{festa2016decomposition,
  abstract = {This paper provides a decomposition technique for the purpose of simplifying the solution of certain zero-sum differential games. The games considered terminate when the state reaches a target, which can be expressed as the union of a collection of target subsets considered as ‚Äòmultiple targets‚Äô; the decomposition consists in replacing the original target by each of the target subsets. The value of the original game is then obtained as the lower envelope of the values of the collection of games, resulting from the decomposition, which can be much easier to solve than the original game. Criteria are given for the validity of the decomposition. The paper includes examples, illustrating the application of the technique to pursuit/evasion games and to flow control.},

@article{shishika2019perimeter-defense,
  abstract = {This paper studies a variant of multi-player reach-avoid game played between intruders and defenders. The intruder team tries to score by sending as many intruders as possible to the target area, while the defender team tries to minimize this score by intercepting them. Specifically, we consider the case where the defenders are constrained to move on the perimeter of the target area. Finding the optimal strategies of the game is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the joint state space. As a tractable approximation, existing methods reduce the design of the defense strategy to an assignment problem by decomposing the game into a combination of one vs. one games. To solve the one vs. one game, those works either rely on numerical approaches or makes simplifying assumptions (e.g., circular perimeter, or equal speed). This paper provides an analytical solution to the case where the target area takes any arbitrary convex shape. We also provide a detailed discussion on the optimality of the derived strategies. In addition, we solve the two vs. one game to introduce a cooperative pincer maneuver, where a pair of defenders team up to capture an intruder that cannot be captured by either one of the defender individually. The existing assignment-based defense strategy is extended to incorporate such cooperative behaviors.},
