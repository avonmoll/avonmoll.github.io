A distributed engine control system (DECS) offering flexibility and scalability is envisioned for the next generation of propulsion controls. Perhaps the most touted benefit of a DECS is the potential to reduce the amount of harnessing which connects throughout the engine. Such a system is comprised of several network sections incorporating control nodes or data concentrators (DCs). These DCs contain control logic to perform control function computations and are connected to the full authority digital engine control (FADEC) via a high-speed data communication bus. A novel approach for analyzing and evaluating three topologies–ring, star, and bus–in the context of a relevant military engine was described. In this study, the algorithm uses a particle swarm optimization process to evolve solutions to a multi-objective optimization problem. The results of this study indicate there is potential for large wire length savings in a distributed control architecture.
