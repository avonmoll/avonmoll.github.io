In this work, we formulate a novel planar motion planning problem of a Dubins-Laser system that consists of a Dubins vehicle with an attached controllable laser. The vehicle moves with unit speed and the laser, having a finite range, can rotate in a clockwise or anti- clockwise direction with a bounded angular rate. From an arbitrary initial position and orientation of the Dubins-Laser system, the objective is to steer the system so that a given static target is within the range of the laser and the laser is oriented at it in minimum time. We characterize multiple properties of the optimal path and establish that the optimal path for the Dubins-laser system is one out of the total 13 candidates. Finally, we provide insightful numerical plots to illustrate the properties characterized in this work.
