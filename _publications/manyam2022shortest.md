We present a path planning problem for a pursuing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to intercept a target traveling on a circle. The target is cooperative, and its position, heading and speed are precisely known. The pursuing UAV has nonholonomic motion constraints, and therefore the path traveled must satisfy the minimum turn radius constraints. We consider the class of Dubins paths as candidate solutions, and analyze the characteristics of the six modes of Dubins paths where the final position is restricted to lie on the target circle with heading in the tangential direction of the circle. For each Dubins mode, we derive the feasibility limits, discontinuities and local extrema. Using this analysis the intercepting paths are found by a systematic bisection search in the feasible regions of each of the Dubins modes. We prove that the algorithm finds the optimal (shortest length) intercepting path if it is a Dubins path. If the shortest intercepting path is not a Dubins path for any given instance, the algorithm finds a tight lower bound and an upper bound to the optimal solution.
