This work derives two basic engagement zone models, describing regions of potential risk or capture for a mobile vehicle by a pursuer. The pursuer is modeled having turn-constraints rather than simple motion. Turn-only (C-Paths) and turn-straight (CS-Paths) paths are considered for the pursuer of limited range. Following the derivation, a simulation of a vehicle avoiding the pursuer&apos;s engagement zone is provided.
