This paper presents a three-dimensional extension of the Basic Engagement Zone (BEZ) as a spherically capped cone, representing a threatâ€™s risk region for a fixed speed target aircraft. The threat is modeled as having a reachability region dictated by a sphere of fixed radius. The resulting three- dimensional BEZ shape at a fixed altitude is also analyzed, offering enhanced understanding for aircraft survivability.
