Mission operations include a myriad of priorities that are subject to change in the field, of which four are commonly used by pilots: Signature Management (SM), Optimize Killing (OK), Weapon Engagement Zone Denial (WEZD), and Mutual Support (MS). The scope of this project includes three of these priorities, namely OK, WEZD, and MS in an effort to mature autonomy in these areas for unmanned platforms. Furthermore, the inclusion of uncertainty of sensor reliability, asset location, target location/strategy, and other factors are a focus of this effort. Air and missile threats in contested airspace represent a challenge for a number of Air Force missions [1]. In concert, some of the tasks include Defensive Counterair (DCA), Offensive Counterair (OCA), Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), Air Mobility Operations (AMO), Strike, and Interdiction. Although not comprehensive, these tasks are required for achieving air superiority to support and defend enemy or friendly airspace. As defined in JP 3-01 [2], in OCA, enemy Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS) attempt to destroy, disrupt, or neutralize penetrations of their airspace. This is an attempt to degrade OCA operations. One way to address enemy IADS is through Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD). SEAD missions neutralize, destroy, or temporarily degrade surface-based enemy Air Defenses (ADs) by destructive or disruptive means.
