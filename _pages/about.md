I am a researcher with the Control Science Center, Aerospace Systems Directorate, Air Force Research Laboratory.
I hold a B.S. from Ohio State (2012) and an M.S. from Georgia Institute of Technology (2016) both in Aerospace Engineering. 
In 2011 I received the Department of Defense SMART Scholarship.
Then in 2014 I received SMART again to pursue my M.S.
Currently, I'm also pursuing a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at University of Cincinnati under [Zach Fuchs](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cr_ZGFkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
In 2019 I received the [Dave Ward Memorial Lecture Award](http://www.acgsc.org/ward_award.php) from the Aerospace Control and Guidance Systems Committee for outstanding contribution to the autonomy of unmanned aerial systems in the area of game-theoretic control in adversarial environments.


My research interests include multi-agent systems, cooperative control, differential games, and pursuit-evasion.
